or 12 of 25 can be alternatively written out as 25 of 12 instead which would be  3

22,7sgpyf,"college isnt the only way to start a good career apprenticeships trade schools and military training can be great alternatives in todays world the price of fouryear universities in the us among other countries is huge and growing there are many situations where the degree is worth the cost but not for everyone obviously if you wish to be a doctor or lawyer a college degree is inevitable

if however your desired path isnt so rigidly grounded in universities or you just arent sure what youd like to do take some time to think about alternatives before applying to colleges

to high school juniors and seniors 

your parentsguardians might be pressuring you to go straight to college because that was practically a guarantee for a good life in their time but things are different today if youre going to broach this subject with them get your sources ready ahead of time herehttpswwwthesimpledollarcomwhyyoushouldconsidertradeschoolinsteadofcollege is a good overview but you should find other data analyses and opinions before fighting that battle

why are skilled trades more relevant now

these jobs have been around for a long time but baby boomers have been overrepresented for decades as that generation retires demand for skilled trades will be a lot higher than it was twenty years ago according to this articlehttpwwwcareerprofilesinfoskilledtradeworkershortagehtml 53 of skilled tradespeople are over the age of 45 anecdotally i work in an industrial setting with a lot of tradespeople and almost all the hair here is grey 

is there any money in it

there definitely can be unlike some collegebound fields you wont likely be making six figures right out the gate if ever that doesnt necessarily mean youll be worse off assuming you go the apprenticeship or military routes you can be making money the day you start and wont have any crippling debt to deal with id recommend reading up on personal finance for more details on the matter but if you start contributing to your retirement at 18 even with less income you could certainly retire with more money than someone who had a higher income but couldnt contribute until _ years to complete degree  _ years to pay off debt later 

thats assuming the college grad can get a job right away there are plenty of highly educated baristas and retail workers in this country who may never be able to retire thanks to student loan debt moreover one cant get rid of student debt by filing bankruptcy youre stuck with any loans you take for school

what are my options

there are a ton of ways to start a career but ill talk about a few

apprenticeships are a great way for experienced tradespeople to pass their handson knowledge to pupils that will some day replace them apprentices will generally be paid very little at first but the cheap labor is in exchange for valuable training once an apprentice is proficient enough to work on their own they will generally be making a nice middleclass wage 

a recent reporthttpswwwnprorg20180104575114570robustapprenticeshipprogramkeytogermanysmanufacturingmight from npr took a look at how apprenticeships play a part in germanys industrial success the us government is also pretty aware of the potential even if they face challenges in funding programs the federal program is herehttpswwwdolgovapprenticeship and you can take advantage of some of their resources in person by finding the nearest american job centerhttpswwwcareeronestoporgsiteamericanjobcenteraspx

the federal government is definitely the only organization pushing apprenticeships in a lot of cases labor unions organize and administer apprenticeships and training one example would be the ibewhttpwwwelectricianapprenticehqcomhowtojoinibewapprenticeship for electricians but there are a too many unions that vary from place to place so i wont bother trying to list a bunch searching for unions near your area may be a good place to start identifying other opportunities

trade schools can be a good way to get the kind of classroom training you might expect from college but much more focused and timecostefficient many community colleges offer trade programs that lead to certifications and associates degrees there are also standalone schools that might specialize in a single trade like welding job corpshttpswwwjobcorpsgovtrain is a national program that can be a good option if a person isnt in a good position to pay for training it isnt for everyone as i understand it is very structured and somewhat militaristic but i know a few people who have completed training there and gone on to nice careers 

training doesnt have to be years long though especially in the arena of computer sciences boot camp programs are becoming very popular a computer programming boot camp might be a big expense for such a short program but its much less expensive than a degree in computer science and could give you enough tools to land a good job right away or even to work for yourself

military training can also be a great economic ladder the pay and benefits are good from the start depending on the specialty the training can be really valuable and free plenty of employers offer some hiring preference to veterans there are some huge risks associated with this route though so i would reserve it as a last resort 

regarding benefits the basic wage isnt a lot higher than minimum wage which is often the subject of salty memes that is not the only income though in most cases living expenses are taken care of so no need to budget for food housing or utilities thats the bulk of what the working class is trying to stay on top of so you could plausibly invest every dollar of pay you earn if you didnt have a cell phone or car even then if you are sensible it would be easy to live below your means another huge benefit is free medical for the whole family on the outside that would cost a lot

regarding training if you win the job lottery you could receive extensive training in a really valuable field some people can walk away from four years of service making over 100000yr you could also be a bus driver you dont really get to choose and that is the first big risk i would say it is much better than a 50 chance that the job training youd get in the military would be worth more than a high school diploma but if you dont want to be a cop and they make you a cop that is a lot of wasted time

regarding lifestyle it can be a great time i really enjoyed most of the time i spent in the military there were a lot of people around me who absolutely hated it and had to suffer through a sixyearlong mistake the good stuff is youre part of a community you might get travel a lot you might have really exciting work to do the bad stuff is the culture can be very very toxic you might have to be away from family for years and being the military there is an above average chance of being killed injured assaulted or developing a mental illness

i know that sounds dramatic but a person shouldnt consider it lightly in reality though chances are high that you could walk away with a pretty good financial start and good opportunities to have a satisfying career


tldr

if you want to get smart go to college if you want a good job and dont want to become a slave to your own debt consider a skilled trade




edit based on a lot of comments it appears that some military branches handle job selection different than others and these things evolve over time as a general rule even if some branch guarantees you a specific job proceed with caution enlisting on an open contract is generally a terrible idea but to clear up some confusion the af lets you pick some jobs you want and requires you to select one of four open aptitudes no thanks is not an open aptitude but if orders come down for you to enlist open general that can be worth thinking long and hard about turning down 

also about the military i offered it up as a last resort and i mean that plenty of commentators are saying dont ever think about joining the military for training i dont know their stories but there is probably something to it so many people cant be wrong you would literally be trading your autonomy up to your life in exchange for a chance for some economic mobility if you arent really interested in the military its not a great idea

regarding rotc it is better than nothing i intentionally didnt mention it though my philosophy is based on my wife and several other relatives doing rotc vs my immediate family and i enlisting if you do rotc you have 8 years from starting school to leaving the military after 8 years you walk away with at least a bachelors degree the ability to check the veteran box some work experience and whatever money you saved up if you enlist in 4 years you can absolutely attain an associates and bachelors degree while you are in if you set your mind to it especially in the af cant say how easy it is in the others so you walk away with a degree the ability to check the veteran box some work experience and whatever money you saved up from a benefits standpoint you can save yourself some time by backloading the school additionally i had a way better time than any officer i know and i didnt even like the military the lifestyles politics corruption and cultures are way different between officers and enlisted i wouldnt wish my understanding of the officers life on anyone

still relevant to rotc but about school in general a ton of people are very happy and successful thanks to their college education im not out to say they are wrong but go to college if you want a good life is neither a compelling nor useful you have surely gotten that line from someone else already",1

open source does what it says on the tin  the code is open for anyone to examine and even adapt and is usually available infull for free occasionally accepting donations if you are so inclined 

this has the added bonus of ensuring there are no nasties like crapware or reporting your user history back to their servers etc because opensource equates to peerreviewed and open to be examined by anyone

edit just because it was mentioned being open source doesnt mean that a program is virusfree but it is a substantially lower risk than closedsource software either way you would be better off with opensource in general

91,60baw1,"got a friend or family in the hospital consider giving them cozy blankets soft socks open toe slippers bookereader reader long phone charger and condiments for food instead of flowers note this is a repost to my previous submission that was removed for an undescriptive title

i was recently hospitalized for the first time in my adult life this made me realize what i would have loved to have based on my sixnight stay


warm comfortable blanket microfleece hospital hvacs systems may not offer local room temperature control but instead make coarse adjustments remotely i was told they could only bump it up or down here at my va hospital also this was the first time i received an iv treatment and let me tell you they are cold had an iv in my forearm and it felt like a cooling coil and i am pretty convinced i could put a fan on it to air condition the room


warm comfortable socks reasons are similar to the blanket explanation maybe socks with gripping pads wouldnt be bad in case they walked on the tile without shoes  credit ugetitgirl007 mentioned that their familyfriends had received socks from the hospital so i followed up and asked my nurse about this  turns out the va hospital does have socks available and my new rn was shocked that no one had offered them to me _ツ_


condiments  i believe hospital food is designed to be lightly seasoned or bland as it may upset a patients stomach this problem might be compounded by medication may have to be on the safe side and confer with the patient for what the could stomach safely edit i recommended conferring with the patient assuming they would be informed of their dietary restrictions and abide by it  generally it would be wiser to consult with the rn or charge nurse regarding what they can have for consumption  


open toe slippers luckily i had flip flops on when i was unexpectedly admitted for my infection making short walks to the bathroom would have been a pain if i only had tennis shoes probably would of went barefoot in that case  


long braided phone charger  my wife brought my 10 ft braided lightning cord and it was great i can easily circumvent their expensive equipment and tuck it somewhere that wouldnt get in the nurses way i recommend braided because they tend to be more durable in my experience also i am using a 5ft usb hub for my charger the extra length is nice to have


entertainment a book ereader word games or anything to help pass the time   the tv service may offer ondemand movies but the selection is slim and the hospital may charge for it as well depending on their administration another option might be to get your patient a googleapple card so they cam purchase some movies if they might have trouble holding the phone for long durations then get a gooseneck cell phone holder that has a clamp connection so you can mount it to the bed the gooseneck will offer a flexible but rigid structure so the patient can adjust it to their preference edit ustjerndale recommended audiobooks  great way to pass the time and not strain your eyes 


gift cards credit u1900grs uhalftimeheaters  gift cards for local restaurants especially with delivery service and gas stations are terrific  


bonus  u1900grs and myself would recommend avoiding flowers balloons and stuffed animal gifts for hospital patients  they take up quite a bit of valuable realestate make it difficult for hospital staff to work and are a burden when you have to pack up for your discharge  this bonus is intended for adult patients

asking for advice thatll be useful so far into the future ensures that itll be timeless and gives people a chance to pass on their wisdom and be remembered long after they would otherwise be forgotten  you can fill it with all sorts of stuff from stories to family recipes to general lpts  make extra copies whenever you have to pass it down to multiple children too",1

97,51av2h,"lpts chrome extensions i wish i knew of back when i started college as i am about to enter my grad school i have been looking for ways to enhance my productivity to make my experience go by easier as a result i recently started exploring chrome extensions and man i wish i had done this earlier some will no longer be of use to me but i hope it can help others 

cite this for me web citerhttpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailcitethisformewebcitennnmhgkokpalnmbeighfomegjfkklklehlen
this one hurts me a bit as my days with mla apa harvard and chicago are coming to an end the extension adds a button to the top of your browser that you simply click and it will automatically site whatever website or article you are on from my experimentation with it it seems to work just as well as easybib or any of those other sites and it is much faster to go through

google dictionaryhttpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailgoogledictionarybygoogmgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcojahlen
if you get this extension you will have no excuse to not know a word that is on a article or text book online its very simple doubleclick or highlight over a word you dont know and it will define it for you i imagine any science or legal majors will love this one in particular 

grammarly for chromehttpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailgrammarlyforchromekbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhenhlen
i often use bad grammar and i know it this extension gives me shit for it all the time but it helps it highlights grammatical or spelling errors for you anywhere and allows you to quickly correct it 

readabilityhttpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailreadabilityoknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdihlen
this extension simply aims to trim the fat off of articles to provide you with the main point i would not trust it for anything in depth but if you are running low on time and need to skim an article id give this a shot 

speakithttpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailspeakitpgeolalilifpodheeocdmbhehgnkkbakhlenus

i know i cant be the only lazy shit who sometimes does not want to actually use my eyes to read text books or articles this app lets you highlight over text you click a button and a pleasant voice reads it to you as you browse reddit or i guess you could take notes as you listen too

it works in several different languages and accents if you somehow understand germanenglish accents over the default one you can also control the speed that it talks to you in words per minute i could see myself playing it out loud randomly just to try and feed the information into my brain but i would still recommend reading like a normal person every once in a while too 

block  focushttpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailblockfocusdcpbedhdekgkhigjgmlcbmcjoeaebbfmhlen

type in the websites that distract you cough and let this thing keep you away manage your workflow and control when you take breaks and when you work there are others like this one and they are all probably worth a shot 

molviewhttpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmolviewnogcacamdkipgkfpfiakaoamdnihinnmhlen

i havent tested this one out but it looks amazing for those who are in ochem or higher it allows you to draw up molecules and look at them 3 dimensionally i was one of those losers that bought an actual molecule set for 40 to understand what im looking at so this might save you money if you have trouble visualizing molecules

bonus tips that i learned


make a folder on your bookmark tab and slide all of your nonproductive websites in there leave a bookmark for any of your online school based websites it will be hard but it has helped me stay away from time wasting sites 

use sleepytimehttpsleepytime for your late night studies or binges its a simple interface that aims to synch you up with your rem cycles for the best sleep possible i cannot say it works every time but this site has saved me some cranky days as i stayed up too late studying 

use rainymoodhttpsrainymoodcom to destress yourself im sure many of you know about it but i love this one

im sure i have missed a lot of good extensions and tips feel free to tell me any i should try out 

use fluxhttpsjustgetfluxcom to dim your pc screen to prevent eye strain and help you fall asleep credit to kreekybonez for that one

good luck in your studies my friends
_________________________________________________________________________
edit cleaned up the post and added the links to the extensions also added flux per kreekybonez as it is one i think people should be aware of

edit thanks for the love guys this blew up way more than i expected glad to help wanted to mention a few things after reading through many of your comments

i hope that most of you know to still be careful with your grammar and citations it isnt really that different from the autocorrect for word and easy bib always double check your writing if it is an important paper especially with citations but if youre like me you can use it for the basics and check over the formatting after the fact just wanted to throw that out there as many redditors have been commenting on those two extensions otherwise thanks for all the suggestions and upvotes of course

im a chef you all have high hopes for how quickly your oven pre heats and how easily you can remove a frozen meal from plastic tupperware to change into an oven safe dish you all also seem to be the type of person who would blast their shit in the microwave anyway because s frozen curry being cooked through in the oven in 20 mins from turning the oven on would mean using a blast furnace also did the title say if youre choosing how to reheat something no it doesnt because im specifically addressing microwave usage so outta here with your faux superiority go make your own thread about ovens and toaster ovens and airfryers not everyone has those things  dorm students may have a cooktop and convection microwave i certainly dont have space for a toaster oven to sit around on my bench like a jerk all day thats what the microwave is for

some facts for yall

bunnies are as much work as a cat if not even more ok it seems they are much more work than a cat

they poop a lot

you need to clean their toilets a lot

you need at least 2 bunnies 1 neutered male 1 female can be spayed


bunnies need at least 2 square meters per bunny and they need to have enough space to run around so better 3 square meters per bunny

bunnies are not for picking up they are prey animals and get scared if you pick it up

they need medical attention as much as dogscats if not even more

you need to take care of their nails or the  vet you trust

179,614eew,"genuinely caring about somebody a lot does not guarantee they care about you equally or at all in return some people will never care about you regardless of what you do or say so dont assume somebody appreciates you just because you do nice things for them this is something that i unfortunately didnt learn until well into adulthood  it may sound obvious when its spelled out but when youre in the actual situation its not always so clear  most of my life i thought if i really cared about somebody a lot then they must care about me to some degree in return it always felt like that connection was so strong it had to be mutual even if the obvious signs showed otherwise despite certain people treating me like dirt and rarely reciprocating i would do everything i could to make them happy i would go out of my way to help them say  do nice things for them encourage them etcwith the assumption theyd eventually show their appreciation for me being in their lives  id think how could they not care about me when i make it so obvious how much i care about them if i just keep trying theyll come around  this was especially true for people who maybe showed signs they cared at some point in the past but werent anymore

what ive learned over the years is that a lot of times that reciprocal connection is imagined the amount you love somebody does not always affect how much they love you back people can and will use you and your emotions and just because somebody may have once cared about you in the past doesnt mean they still do now or ever will again in the futuretheres often nothing you can do to change their feelings through any good deeds or kind words 

im not talking about classic nice guy syndrome not the crush who friendzoned you that youre desperately trying to win over by being nice when there should have never been any expectation of feelings to begin withim talking about people who you genuinely feel a meaningful connection with whether that be friends family or romantic partners

i wasted a lot of time on people expecting them to suddenly start reciprocating my feelings and actions id be convinced i could win people over or back overincluding bad friends and former relationshipsif i was just nice enough to them and let my feelings be known looking back i should have cut my loses far sooner i should have focused more on finding people who not only cared about me but wanted to make me happy in return

its important not to assume somebody appreciates you just because you love them and do good things for themyou can waste a lot of time and energy focusing on people who will never really care no matter what you do



edit i should note i dont mean to say you should only do good things for people if you expect something in return there is nothing wrong with being nice to people just because it makes you happy even if they dont appreciate it but you cant expect them to some day change their minds and you shouldnt let your desire to please people who dont care about you distract you from finding people who do",1

this will get lost but at the very least some people will see this and correct this mistake i made 

here is a link to relative noise volumeshttpswwwchempurdueeduchemsafetytrainingppetraindblevelshtm also when youre outside in a bustling city or on a subway you might decide to turn up your volume to high and unsafe levels so that your music overpowers the noise around you dont do this

edit im glad this is reaching many people if you have friends or family members please inform them as well i often think about why many of us are never taught about the importance of protecting our ears if you can hear someones music through their earbuds then it is most likely far too loud if you google tinnitus definition and you expand the definition box you will see that its been on the rise lately

edit 2 hello everyone ive been seeing a lot of post here thanks for sharing for anecdotes and informing others of how your tinnitus came to be just a few things to keep in mind not all tinnitus is caused by hearing loss or loud  noise tinnitus can occur if youre sick or if you have an ear infection earwax buildup  or even through medication or in rare cases if you have tmj in these cases they may or may not be permanent i dont want to scare you and i would highly recommend going to your ent ear nose and throat doctor as soon as possible also remember that just because there isnt a cure for tinnitus does not mean there may be professional treatment out there that can significantly improve your quality of life this is important to remember see your ent to get these ruled out 

as uohcleo mentioned dont clean your ears by putting cotton sticks in your ear canal this is how you cause earwax blockage 

edit3 ive been reading all of your comments here i will include some notable suggestions ive read but may be lost in the pool of comments we have 1 also wear earplugs while motorcycling drumming if youre a musician  

2 dont wear earplugs all the time only when necessary wearing earplugs for too long can also damage your ears 

3 there are earplugs called etymoticjust search for earplugs that dont muffle sound earplugs or musician earplugs that actually keep the sounds the same and in some cases even help sounds sound better but at a lower volume 4 listening to music for too long even at medium volume can still cause damage take breaks 

uukralibre said thats interesting but its almost impossible to convince people to use protection before they get harmed however by then itll be too late take all these anecdotes from your fellow redditors and heed this 

edit 4 i put more emphasis on not wearing earplugs all the time only when necessary because thats important it can lead to hyperacusis you want to protect your ears from loud noises not every noise 

edit 5 for many of us tinnitus redditors if you already have it its not as bad as it sounds have you ever smelled something that smelled awful initially but after a while you dont even notice it anymore or that car smell that you recognize when you first enter a car but after a while inside the car it just disappears same with your tinnitus only itll take a little bit longer than that

our brains are amazing and have crazy adaptive capabilities also known as brain plasticityhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvadlld97clm your brain will begin to ignore the phantom ringing but the ringing itself will not subside i know how ludicrous this sound but i have i personally have habituated to the sound myself and im pretty much back to my normal life things like stress and caffeine can cause a spike in your t for now use background noise like rain drops or white noise perhaps a 10 hour video of a busy cafe on safe volumes of course as always seek medical or professional help nonetheless ",1

the next number would be 13  21  34

heres the thing 5 mi  8 km 8 mi  13 km 13 mi  21 km and so on

edit you can also do this with multiples of these numbers eg 510  810 50 mi  80 km if youve got an odd number that doesnt fit in the sequence you can also just round to the nearest fibonacci number and compensate for this in the answer eg 70 mi  80 mi 80 mi  130 km subtract a small value like 15 km to compensate for the rounding and the end result is 115 km

this works because the fibonacci sequence increases following the golden ratio 11618 the ratio between miles and km is 11609 or very very close to the golden ratio hence the fibonacci sequence provides very good approximations when converting between km and miles",1

201,58hw8h,"a real effective apology has three parts 1 acknowledge how your action affected the person 2 say youre sorry 3 describe what youre going to do to make it right or make sure it doesnt happen again dont excuse or explain most people treat an apology as a way to explain their point of view but that feels to the listener like making excuses or minimizing their experience 

say your roommate accidentally ruins your  couch by spilling a big cup of coffee on it think about which youd rather hear 

mediocre apology 
im so sorry i just got startled when my phone buzzed and i accidentally knocked it over it was totally an accident i feel terrible

good apology
i know you really like the look of that couch and now its got a stain on it  you must be really bummed about that im so sorry id be happy to pay for a cleaning and in the future ill keep my drinks in the kitchen 

edit reading through the comments i think i should clarify im talking about situations where you feel bad about something you did or said and want to clear the air with an apology this is not applicable to situations where you feel you did nothing wrong or dont want to apologize

7 you plagiarized this from jimmy johnsdr lauradaniel tigerother 7

9 and for the love of fsm never say im sorry you feel that way or im sorry but because thats awful 6

205,8szqi8,"never take a problem to your boss until you have multiple solutions to it it may seem obvious to some but imagine the difference between an employee coming to you with a problem that you then have to figure out how to solve vs an employee coming to you with a problem they already have several solutions for and you simply need to choose as the manager which option you believe is best 

in my experience when most employees come across a problem they dont know how to instantly solve they simply present it to their manager and wait for a response 

this does nothing other than concrete your managers opinion that you are unable to do their job and they subconsciously disqualify you from promotion presenting them with multiple solutions to a problem however makes them feel they are in control whilst simultaneously considering you as an asset worthy of promotion or at the very least retention

edit couple of things that have come up

1 time frame  i wasnt suggesting withholding critical information from your superior if you have 30 seconds to tell them come up with some ideas in that 30 seconds even if they are bad ideas it shows you are willing to employ critical thinking in important situations you can teach someone with bad ideas how to improve them you cant teach someone with no ideas how to have them

2 trivial matters  obviously dont bother your boss with trivial decisions that are a normal part of your job it should be clear based on the roles and responsibilities of your position which decisions need management oversight and which are well within your jurisdiction to make if that distinction is unclear it is certainly something you should clarify with your manager

3 you should just make the decision yourself  in many situations this is correct from a pure efficiency standpoint but often if you dont take things to a manager your solving them goes unnoticed and your clever decision making is superfluous it is a fine line between irritating and impressing your manager and that line can vary wildly depending on the individual but generally speaking when combined with common sense it works

4 management perspective  i am not currently a manager over the past 20 years i have bounced back and forth between employeremployee in different companies combined roughly 8 years as a manager and 12 years as an employee i am not complaining about my current situation i am very happy and follow this on a daily basis

however the moment you go running to your coworkers proudly telling them youve just given your notice that opportunity is gone management generally doesnt need the appearance of weakness and counter offers are precisely that if half the company knows and you ended up staying with the company everyone knows what happened and it fosters bad behavior

2 seems that the consensus is that every single person in the workforce outside of the fabled top performer is underpaid  i can assure you that that isnt the case  many times people have that impression and they are actually perfectly within their pay bands  go ahead tear me apart for this its just the truth

1 realize that underpromising and overdelivering is not an attempt to be dishonest it can actually be more honest giving you a buffer in case weird stuff comes up traffic health issues the other obligation you hadnt originally factored in people often tell if you are just lying to them to impress them 

2 upod only works in relationships in the long term if the underpromise is still relatively close to what your gut estimate would have been in the first place  you shouldnt tell your so that you will be home at 10pm every evening and show up at 630pm every day as 630pm will be the new expectation regardless of what you say and what you say will lose credibility

3  dont overpromise to try to initially impress someone it will hurt you in the end  if you are like me you want others to think highly of you which might tempt you to offer to do something quicker or much better than you probably cant do or only can do under ideal circumstances  this is especially true for people in new jobs and new relationships  although this might work out for you initially you work crazy hours to meet a crazy deadline that you set for yourself to impress someone it comes with some natural consequences that are nobodys fault but your own  first of all you have now set the bar very high for yourself making it difficult to over upod with them again  many will going forward expect you to maintain that expectation of you going forward  second even if you somehow manage to keep it up you will eventually opud over promise and under deliver which can really hurt you in the end  you might also come to resent the other person because of their expectations of you even though in truth you were the one that initially seeded those expectations in the first place  

4 when starting out buffer upod with i wish statements  i have 4 kids and with my md phd training i literally cannot make it to all of my childrens extracurricular events  at the beginning of each school year i remind my kids that although i wish i could make it to every event i will not be able to attend everything every time i show up my kids are totally stoked  i sometimes wait until just a few hours before to let my kids know i can make it to an event even though my wife has a much more advanced heads up just to manage expectations  although some might say that this makes it hard for my kids to feel that they can rely on me or trust me i have found quite the opposite  i have an almost 100 success rate at being to the things that i say i will be at 

5 when employing upod focus conversations on what you know 100 that you can do  for instance when a colleague is really trying to pressure you to attend a conference that you probably dont have time to attend reply with i really wish i could go but i probably cant  could you do me a favor when you get back and do lunch with me to discuss the interesting tidbits you learnedshared at the conference   when a customer at your restaurant asks you to make a specialty order that you are not sure the chef can do let them know i will check with the chef to see if i can do this for you but it is unlikely that we can do this  however i can bring you some free extra breadsticks that i can see you have all enjoyed so much this evening   

6  you can maintain an optimistic attitude while still upoding to yourself  i just realized that upoding yourself sounds really weird but my point is that it helps to have realistic expectations of yourself and to give yourself some buffer  i used to always tell myself that i would get more workhomework done over christmas vacation  turns out i was always disappointed at how much i actually got done  now before the break i tell myself i will be happy to get 10 or so hours worth of work done each vacation period if i get more done i am pretty proud of myself   for instance even though i spent about an hour putting this post together i am only really expecting it to be looked at by about 20 people with only about 5 or 6 reading all the way to this point  this is okay to me as if it helps even one or two people enjoy the success i have it is worth it also i plan on sharing some of this directly with my close friends and family   

7 underexpect in your own relationships with others and give people a break  realize that thing come up and that everyone is fighting a hard battle  teach them in gentle ways how to upod 

8 in some instances it is okay to let them know that you are upoding  example tell your friends that you would love to play games with them online this evening but you are pretty sure that your boss is likely going to keep you after work because he usually does on a friday evening  i say some instances because excessive explanations might actually get them to distrust you especially if the explanations are beyond their current level of comprehension  for example for some when a mechanic or doctor starts using words that no one has ever heard of people become suspicious or resentful of that person  for instance you dont need to explain why the pizza might be an extra 5 minutes later just quote them 5minutes later and wow them when you get there 10 minutes early  

i apologize if this felt like a lecture i just would have loved if a parent or mentor had shared these with me before i had to learn many of these caveats the hard way    thanks for those of you that made it through all of this i am excited to hear from you about what you have learned about the art of upod

tldr  underpromising and overdelivering has helped my life and will help your life but there is an art to it

262,7rmd08,"if youve had the same internet service plan for a while take a look at what your isps current advertised plans are you may be grandfathered in on a slower more expensive plan realized this the other day and i wish i had figured it out years ago my family has been on the same internet  phone  cable package from knology now wow for over a decade after fees and taxes my dad was paying 270mo for the whole package and though i dont know the cablephone details i do know we were only getting 20 mbps down2 mbps up internet speed that didnt seem right to me so i went and took alook

on their website this isp does not seem to offer any plan that has 20 down2 up internet speed they do have a 10d1u singleuser service standalone internet but in their package deals they only had 50 100 500 and 1000 internet speeds no 20

turns out weve been paying for the same service at the same rate for the past 15 years so while highspeed internet was getting faster and the cost was going down we were still paying what was considered a fair price for what was considered a high speed in the early 2000s

one call to the isp our plan was changed over the phone and a tech came out today and installed the new modem we are now getting 1gbps up down 50 mbps down up have the same phone and cable service as before and are paying 30 a month less than before

edit for like the 50th time i typed down when i meant to type up and up when i meant to type down my speed is 1g down 50m up not the other way around

also as people have mentioned in the comments this doesnt apply to every isp and in fact some isps will do the opposite they will actually prohibit you from upgrading your plan if youre a longtime user as their good deals are only for new customers wow seems to be pretty decent as far as customer service goes but i cant speak for any other isp",1

267,5qaxaf,"a goal towards a tidier home is not through periodic binge cleaning but by keeping the house clean through small everyday tasks to have a tidy livable house that is always ready for unexpected visitors you should focus on small tasks that keep your house clean everyday

for example if you pick up a book or a magazine up or play a board game put it back after use

if you use a blanket fold it up after you get up anything that is displaced when in use  even a pencil or a remote

instead of piling dishes in the sink try to wash your cup or plate immediately after you use it this will leave the sink free and you will only need to wash the larger cooking dishes after youre done cooking 
extra protip if you have something on the kitchen counter put it where it belongs even in the sink so that your counter is always clear even if your sink is piled up with large dishes but you have clean counters its still a better look than a tidy sink surrounded by dirty counters

what this leaves is a tidier clutter free home which will only require mostly vaccuming dusting andor mopping when unexpected visitors arrive you dont have to scramble

i never have to do much in my room my closet is a bit tougher to maintain but the rest of the things are always tidy and in their place i have siblings who keep their rooms messy and then they binge clean later it works for them but i dont think thats an efficient method

of course its harder when there are more people in the house but if you encourage as many people as you can then the clutter will reduce

edit massive response thanks the point is to do small tasks everyday so that it 1 doesnt buildup 2 helps you maintain a habit of cleanliness where you naturally clean something the moment you see it 3 makes your homes default setting as clean  

also if your house is massively cluttered then its a good idea to do a binge clean first and then maintain it by doing small chores everyday its said that if you do something for long enough say 40 days it becomes a habit 
edit 2 when you rely on binge cleaning your mindset is that you dont want to do it now because you can do it later this makes you less likely to clean as you go whats the point when you can do it later so the best way is to binge clean once and maintain it by cleaning after yourself
also i missed a word in the title sorry

309,5fxmbr,"how to meal plan like a champ my meal planning and grocery shopping habits are something i really pride myself on over the last 3 years ive worked really hard to maximize efficiency in this area therefore saving me a lot of time and money i thought i would share my process and tips to help anyone out who might be struggling in this area please feel free to share any additional tricks you have


get started

take a look at your bank account history and add up all the money you spend on food each month factor in your grocery expenses fast food coffee snacks from the gas station etc find the average and use that as a point of comparison for how much you spend while meal planning this part isnt mandatory but i find it really neat to compare commit to 1 month of meal planning your comparison results will be skewed if you go off track


meal planning

1 first you need to think about how all the parts of you life habits and preferences should factor into your plan how many people do you need to feed how many nights do you want to cook how long will you realistically eat leftovers for do you have an obligation one evening that could affect your plan its really important to think about all of these things and seriously consider your familys habits for example i wont eat leftovers twice if i plan for that i always end up going off track because 3 day old food is just not appealing to me also i dont feel like cooking a big meal every night so i build in an easy meal that i can make with my toddler that doesnt take a lot of time think grilled cheese and tomato soup i also enjoy spending sundays preparing a big meal so i know that will influence which recipes i choose for the week

2 choose your recipes its important to read the instructions and ingredients before adding them to your list there is nothing more frustrating than getting home ready to make your meal and realizing it should have been marinated overnight also if you see an ingredient you are not familiar with check google for substitutes that way if you get to the store and they dont carry it you already have an alternative in mind this happens often with health foods which might only be carried at specialty stores if youre trying to save money consider which ingredients such as meat will be more costly bonus if you can find recipes that use the same ingredients this will save you money 

3 figure out which recipes will be made which night i personally plan my healthier meals at the beginning of the week because im more motivated by friday i might want some comfort food to take a load off the stress of the week there is some flexibility to switch around meals by night but i like to space out my meals so that im not eating similar things two nights in a row if you plan to eat out be honest with yourself and add it in your planbudget dont plan 7 nights of  cooking if you cant stick to it if you plan a meal and eat out instead youre wasting money and food i personally plan 4 nights of real meals 1 easy night 1 fend for yourself night and 1 night of eating out 

4 plan your lunch some people mealprep lunches at night but i find that takes way too long i also dont want to meal prep 5 lunches on sunday that i am sick of by wednesday i always make enough dinner to have left overs for both my husband and i for lunch and plan one free day to buy lunch i would recommend this to anyone on a budget  

5 plan your breakfast the costs of coffee and breakfast sandwiches really add up a quick healthy breakfast is not hard to plan i normally do oatmeal fruit eggs or english muffins i pick one of those things and eat them all week i will switch it up the following week each of these are good for a grab n go breakfast 


make your grocery list

1 throughout the week keep a sticky note on your fridge every time you run out of something write it on the list

2 make a list of all the ingredients from each recipe

3 take inventory anything on your list thats already in your pantry you can cross off if you notice your low on a staple add it to your list dont forget to consider nonfood essentials toilet paper cleaning supplies toiletries etc

4 add all items from your collected list from the past week 

5 share your list with familyroommates they can tell if you if there is something you are forgetting or if they have a request 

6 now reorganize your list by department this is important it will help you move through the grocery store more efficiently without having to go back for something you missed i separate mine by dry frozen nonfood dairy bakery meat and produce 


get to the store

1 dont forget to grab your coupons

2 at the store stay focused if its not on your list dont buy it period impulse shopping is no good

3 start with the inner isles canned goods nonfood etc those are heavier and nothing is worse than having cans on top of tomatoes

4 finish up with bakery meat and produce if you are planning healthy meals this should be the bulk of your cart produce is cheap relatively cheap and if you fill your cart with it you will save money

5 double check that youve crossed everything off your list before you leave

tip dont forget to buy on sale but only if its a smart move dont buy one get one half off on perishable items that you wont eat within the week do take up good deals on your essentials rice frozen vegetables oils condiments make sure to compare sales sometimes the store brand price is already lower than the name brand sale


there you have it thats really my entire meal planning and shopping process from there all you have to do is start cooking it takes practice to get it down but when youve got it figured out it starts to get easy


here are some additional tips i would recommend

1 type your meal plan with links to recipes and save them when you dont feel like meal planning you can resort to the archives

2 if you dont have a food processor get one its cheap and saves you so much prep time

3 crock pot meals are amazing for those nights you want to get home and just relax only problem is you have to prepare them the night before or in the morning 

4 sign up for emails from sites like myfitnesspal or cooking light its a great place for inspiration 

5 plan to have a night that you dont need a recipe for grilled chicken and frozen broccoli requires like zero brainwork after a long day thats important

6 remember that cooking is an art once you have enough experience in the kitchen you dont need to spend as much time finding recipes im at the point where i use recipes for inspiration  but i change them depending on my preferences 

6 remember to bring your lunch whats the point in all this if you end up buying lunch everyday anyway seriously set an alarm on your phone if you have to but dont forget your lunch

7 plan desserts i have a weakness for cookies i actually might be addicted if i plan in a night of cookie baking it helps me from running to mcdonalds at 9pm

8 remember to stay stocked on your pantry staples this listhttpwwwfoodnetworkcomrecipesarticlesbasicpantry101html can help you determine what those are

329,5y0t9s,"charge a small adoption fee to prevent snake owners from using your free puppies or kittens as food i have a coworker who routinely looks at online advertisements for free puppies kittens or bunnies she will pretend to be getting the animal for her children but will really take it home and feed it to her reticulated python she admitted that she wont pay over 10 to feed the snake charging a small adoption fee of 15 or 20 will deter her and other like minded individuals from dishonestly taking the animals for a food source 

note i understand that snakes are animals too and need to eat im not bashing on snakes or snake owners i merely take issue with the dishonest means by which this is happening in some examples that she shared with me the previous owners are calling and texting to check in on the animals so she lies to them if these people care enough to check up on the animal they most likely would not have given the animals away if the true intent were known sketchy 

edit wow this ended up being a really controversial topic for the record this is a true story this woman is emotionally unstable and quite frankly doesnt have the mental agility to pull off a prank on this level as some have suggested i do agree with many of you who have pointed out the possible warning signs of a sociopath and i will definitely be reporting her thank you to all those who pmd me resources and contact information 

also i had never considered the concept of the bait dogsfighting dogs and i found that to be enlightening as well  as some have mentioned the dog fighting rings may be the bigger more prominent threat there were many comments that mentioned the fee really doesnt solve the problem and that solid interviewing and vetting of new owners is a better strategy i do not disagree the argument of spayingneutering pets was also made and again i do not disagree the purpose of this post was not to spark ethical debate about the food chain or which type of animals should be labeled food vs pets nor was the purpose of this post to vilify snakes or their responsible owners this story would have read the same even if the animal she owned was a saltwater crocodile 

my goal in sharing this post was to raise awareness that there are sketchy people out there who are dishonest in their dealings and who may not have your pets best interest at heart so whether charging a fee or conducting more extensive interviews or spayingneutering we can all be a little more responsible with the animals we value to make sure that they do not needlessly suffer hence the

351,50ejpi,"when working retail replace sorry for the waittrouble with thank you for your patience a few months ago i started working for a coffee shop in a rich neighborhood  a lot of customers get upset if they dont get their drink right away and it doesnt help that were often very busy  ive found that switching sorry about the wait with thank you for your patience makes quite the difference

sorry for the wait is a very negative phrase  sorry implies that the listener has to deal with something unpleasant due to a fault of the speaker  wait implies frustration and impatience

thank you for your patience on the other hand is much more positive  thank you is flattering to the customer  people feel good when theyre thanked  patience implies calm and understanding  on top of this its easy to say with a smile  people tend to not feel as comfortable getting upset at somebody who is smiling  its a lot harder to say a negative statement like sorry for the wait with a smile as saying sorry means you are expressing sympathy or admitting fault

of course its not going to work 100 of the time  some people are just irrational and impatient  but id say a good 90 of the time when i use thank you for your patience the customer responds with no problem or dont worry about it

edit okay so a few things to mention here

a lot of people are saying thank you for your patience is condescending  tone is a very important thing here  if you say it in a tone like an elementary school teacher speaking to 10 year olds then yes it is condescending  when using this phrase you have to use a tone that shows the customer that you genuinely are grateful that they have been patient  and the key here is being genuine  if you dont give a shit about their wait then no matter how you say it its going to come off as condescending  if you genuinely appreciate that they are waiting your tone is going to come off much more friendly and appreciative  this wont really work if you just use your generic retail voice

some people are saying that the apology is better because you are taking responsibility for it  the thing ive learned about retail is that if you take responsibility for every thing that goes wrong youre going to have a miserable time  if it is your own mistake such as ringing in an order wrong an apology usually wont hurt  but theres no need for you to apologize if somebody else made the mistake or if a customer came in with a large order or if you cant do something due to company policy or really for anything that happens outside of your control  saying sorry in those situations only makes you a target for the customers anger

people are inclined to mimic the behaviors of those around them  if you act in a very positive manner with a smile and positive words most people will act positively in return  if you speak with many negative words it makes it more likely that the person will react more negatively in return  its not going to work 100 of the time  play it by ear  some situations may work better if you apologize  some people would rather have their ego stroked with a thank you while other would rather hear you apologize  but ive found in my experience working with a large number of customers every day people tend to react more positively to thank you for your patience simply because it is a more positive sounding statement",1

355,5hsx5d,"view your time as an investment and pay attention to what gives you the greatest return think of how stingy you are with your money if someone on the street asks for 10 youre not giving it to them theres no way youre giving a 30 tip for a normal dining experience and so on 

and yet so many of us just waste ungodly amounts of our time we throw it away every day i know i do unless im careful what helps me to not waste time is to see it as an investment and to keep track of the returns i get for my investment 

this approach has led me to recognize that some things offer incredible immediate return on investment a night spent learning a new song on my preferred instruments for example gives me a lifetime of being able to play that song thats an incredible return other investments are more like lowinterest high security longterm investments going to the gym eating right etc some like reading good books are kind of a combination of both 

but many activities are worthless from an investment perspective whatever benefit they seem to give doesnt last any longer than the activity itself reddit is a great example i can get superinvested in a reddit conversation but at the end the second i shut down my computer ive gained nothing in return it gives me absolutely nothing of value ive invested my time into junk 

edit some obvious things here first of all whats valuable and not is ultimately your own personal judgement if you feel that your time spent on reddit helps you build the life that you want then by all means fill your boots it doesnt build the life that i want though  and yes im aware that that seems hypocritical but the fact is that i am highly aware that im procrastinating right now and that ill loathe my time spent on reddit when i lay my pretty head down to sleep tonight 

edit sorry i criticized reddit omg but for real maybe you guys are all just a hell of a lot more disciplined on here than i am you come for salient information trenchant and highminded interactions with others and then you sign out in a crisp and efficient manner not i reddit is one of my boogeymen so feel free to substitute your own timewaster

final edit holy smokes if i would have known this was going to blow up i would have taken more than 45 seconds to write it and would have made some things a bit clearer theres some confusion or perhaps defensiveness about the point i was trying to make first of all the examples that i used were all solitary pursuits but that was just random  for instance for myself i dont think that theres a better investment of my time than playing music with my friends or going on trips with friends and family those memories last a lifetime absolutely worth every second  and dollar secondly i definitely dont want to imply that time invested in experiences is a waste  thats the exact opposite of what im trying to say experiences rather than material things are what ive chased for most of my adult life 

really this never should have blown up because its not profound in the least we all know that wasting time leads to unhappiness all i was trying to say is that one strategy that has helped me to avoid wasting time is to see time spent on something as an investment and to question what return on it im getting investing my time in learning a new skill being a good husband and father making new memories with friends and family  those investments will yield a good life other investments wont  eating junk food late at night on reddit for example and for me yes reddit is a serious time sink  something that im trying to deal with 

lastly id push back a tiny little bit against people saying that time spent enjoying yourself isnt wasted mostly i agree but sometimes avoidance takes the form of enjoyment if theres something that i know i need to do and i watch netflix instead hell yeah i enjoy myself during that time doesnt mean that it wasnt a shitty investment of time though so dont confuse avoidanceescapism with true enjoyment",1

having been to a lot of corporations it became apparent to me early on in my career that hr is more about protecting the corporation and mitigating the risks of lawsuits as apposed to protecting the interests of the employee

in leaked targetwalmart videos that attempted to paint labor unions as horrible they used phrases like open door policy referring to an employee being able to discuss anything with a manageremployer which would be removed if big bad labor unions got in the way or we are a family

in no uncertain terms should you view your employer as family in most cases you are an expense and it really is a race to the bottom how little can they do for you in return for you working for them and generating revenuevalue

a jobcareer is simply an agreement between what you think your value is and what the corporation feels you are worth as an expense the more confident you are in yourself and the more you look for other opportunities the better off you will be 

working extra hours above 40 hours a week if you are salaried anyway is something we all dodid and its only when you are older and wiser that you realize that extra time is not worth the extra 1 bump in your salary shopping around for other companies can and do bump you 520 depending on roleresponsibilities doing so constantly is the best way to maximize your income in the long run

that being said there are exceptions to the rule the company i was at for 4 years contributed 50 match to my 401k up to the federal limit so if i put in 16k they would match 8k with a 4 year vesting period situations like that are useful for retirement 

before the 1970s it was considered good practice to reinvest in your workforce provide them with equitypensions as a way to retain people as automationtechnological revolutions occurred the value of each individual lessened additionally during the 1970s a new train of though started being taught in business schools that quarter over quarter profits for shareholders were more important than anything else as a result trim the fat became a mantra that future executives would hold dear as well as be compensated against

had a good quarter awesome had a bad one perhaps we should replace you

396,3wy6pd,"what to do when your partner has a crush edit its been about 3 months since i posted this and i still get the occasional personal message from someone who is dealing with this stuff and looking for advice im always happy to read your situation and offer my thoughts i check this account a couple times a week if not every day

reddit tends to have a black  white view of cheating that i find naive crushes tend to walk the line of emotional cheating but honestly i think they happen in even the most healthy relationships and as long as you both want to work through them they are worth working through

my wife and i have dealt with crushes several times over our 10 years together once for me and twice for her i swear if i asked reddit for help during the times she had crushes cuz it was shitty times it would have told me to walk away with a couple hundred upvotes and that would have been the absolute worst advice weve been married two years now though weve been devoted to each other for ten years and could not be happier each time has been a chance to make both ourselves and our relationship stronger so i decided to share our success with reddit to maybe help other relationships obviously you should leave a relationship that is not healthy but i dont think you should throw away a relationship note the crushes all happened before we were married

what are crushes

crushes are accidental feelings someone has for another person ie not their partner this is different from people who seek out relationships via tinder etc usually they are with a coworker or classmate because these are people they bump into a lot they develop a friendship and either over time or sometimes quite suddenly they feel they hit it off they might feel the infatuation so strongly its like they are in love again they probably feel confused and incredibly guilty because they love their partner so much how could they feel such strong emotions for another person and for you it must feel like a huge breach of trust you gave them their heart how could they

i think it happens by accident and its normal and its hard as shit but as long as you both truly love each other and truly want to get past it you can and your relationship will be that much stronger if you do

what are the right conditions for a crush to occur

crushes happen when theres a perfect storm of variables edit i got some feedback on this so id like to change it crushes can happen at any time in a relationship for a various reasons though i think the most pervasive crushes occur when there is a perfect storm of variables

1 the relationship is strained every relationship goes through hard times there are ups and there are downs and crushes tend to happen when there are downs

2 you or your partners life is strained outside the relationship maybe money is tight maybe work is in overdrive family is sick life really sucks sometimes and it can make us stressed which can transfer into our relationship we are more tense and show our love less we might still feel it its just harder to show because were constantly stressed about other things

3 the partner is at workschool more than at home awake this one is pretty much all the time well be at work or in class more hours in the day than we are at home with our partner then he is accidentally spending more time with a coworker or classmate than he is at home maybe they share an office maybe they are in all the same classes hes not trying to seek her out they just happen to be in the same place most of the dayweek 

4 the crush represents what you are dissatisfied in with your partner this might be kind of a cold way to think about it but relationships can be thought of in terms of pros  cons for example my wife is not into scifi like i am but this classmate did we bonded over our favorite star trek series and before i knew it i had a crush in reality my wife has a hundred more pros than this crush but this crush had a pro where my wife had a con

so your partner has a crush what now

like i said my wife and i have dealt with this several times over our relationship and each time weve set ground rules and each time weve come out stronger and more in love than before

1 keep open and honest communication at all times and work through it together dont hide your feelings from your partner even if you want to protect the other person you might not want to talk about it wether you have the crush or they do but you have to communicate you have to know what your partner is going through at all times work through it together and youll come out together

2 dont be alone with your crush like never meet up for coffee because while she cant avoid working with him she can avoid seeing him other outside of work meeting up like that is a chance at taking intimacy to a deeper level you might want her to cut off ties to him entirely but often thats next to impossible to implement think of this like a soft cutting off ties think about it you have your work friends and then you have your friends you hang out with it puts a barrier there

3 never complain or joke about your partner to your crush even the most innocent joke can indicate you are not happy with your relationship

4 spend more quality time together these crushes happen in part because we are at workschool more than we are awake at home so overcompensate a little turn off the tv get off facebook  reddit and play board games or go for walks i always think the free dates are more intimate than going out to dinner  drinks because that can feel like throwing money at your relationship but those can be fun too

5 dont give ultimatums this is a very common tactic in these situations and i think it only does harm to the relationship it might seem like a good test of their devotion to you but when you are emotional which you definitely will be if you are going through this please consider you might not be setting a reasonable ultimatum more importantly giving any ultimatum however reasonable tells your partner that you value your needs over your relationship even more importantly giving an ultimatum forces them to work on the problem on their own voiding the chance to work together which is in violation of rule 1 above and makes it 10x harder to resolve it says to them i give up its your problem fix it or its over my parents got married on an ultimatum so believe me when i tell you it doesnt work the way you think it should im glad they got married and all because i exist and all but that shit never got resolved 

giving an ultimatum ends the relationship no matter what your partner chooses

however in the end if your partner has a crush maybe its not worth it for you to work through their crush its a really hard process and maybe youre not up to the challenge maybe you really do value your own needs over this relationship and wouldnt mind breaking up which is why you might be tempted to give an ultimatum but lets be real thats not because of their crush or anything they did its because you dont value the relationship enough to keep working at it when things get tough and maybe you shouldnt value it maybe its a bad relationship and you should give it up but just be honest about why youre giving up and dont give an ultimatum

these above rules are really simple and are relatively easy to implement its the emotional turmoil the whole thing puts on your relationship that is hard obviously you need to set your own rules between you and your partner im just sharing whats worked for us i hope this helps you if you ever find yourself in one of these not fun situations

with the first crush we set these ground rules together and weve stuck to them and theyve all passed over we were able to figure out the issues in our own relationships that contributed to crush happening in the first place and so our relationship is that much stronger

edit 1 thanks for the gold i cant take all the credit only half

edit 2 some people have mentioned polyamory as alternatives to my suggestions like i said before these are ground rules we came up with together because it works for both of us and neither of us are interested in polyamory if that is something both you and your partner are interested in you will need to set different ground rules but other than that its the same idea open  honest communication deep respect for your partner and not breaking the ground rules whatever you set the same goes for threesomes and open relationships

edit 3 to those alphas calling me betaasfuck that im emasculatingcompromising myself that i cant keep my woman in line etc this is advice for a healthy relationship healthy relationships are built on open communication of feelings and respect for your partner if you feel like you should control your woman in order to keep her from looking at other men then that is not a healthy relationship its a controlling one and if someone is in a controlling relationship chances are they are unhappy and if they are unhappy chances are they will be looking for another healthier relationship in effect you are creating a situation that encourages cheating 

and regarding me being betaasfuck i dont even consider that an insult alphas as i understand it view women as objects to be controlled and used to meet the alphas own needs if you want to insult me call me an alpha though that would be undeniably off base in the first place",1

using this technique i went from never hearing back from job applications to being inundated with replies and offersalbeit starter jobs but youve got to start somewhere

im not saying this is a magical onestopsolution but it may help

question how would you deal with conflict resolution

answer

context working as a front desk receptionist i recall a time where a customer came in really aggressive and angry because his money was stopped

action i looked into the situation and found that he needed to provide xyz and explained how to do so

result customer left happy came back with the documents and was happy knowing his payment would be resumed

here is the link to their site httpspostalinspectorsuspisgov  i called them today to report this exact issue and was routed to a real live person very quickly and they were courteous and very helpful took all pertinent information and confirmed it and let me know i would be contacted in the next 23 business days  it was all very efficient and easy 

suggest to family members and people that might send cash in a card to instead send a check since theyre easier to track can do stop payments if necessary if they must send cash have them send in a standard sized security envelope the kind that have some type of pattern on the inside to make them less transparent or in a standard sized not security envelope but wrapped in a piece of lined paper or two so it isnt readily apparent whats inside 


edit wow this got popular 
 
 because there may be some confusion reporting to your post office is not the same as reporting to the postal inspector

 i posted this because i have recently had my mail arrive deliberately opened  and i mean the envelope was sealed with packing tape that had been sliced through presumably with a knifelike object  

 i am in the us but from the comments it looks like the uk has something similar for their mail  a quick google search looked to have some good resources

 theres a lot of folks saying nothing will happen and that may be the case but from reading the web site it looks like they determine whether to investigate based on trends and number of reports  if several people in a neighborhood are being affected maybe try getting everyone to call in and report the issue so the inspectors dont write it off to the mail machine probably tore up the envelope

 if you can tell me how to get rid of the picture i would be happy to  when i added the link to the inspectors site i guess reddit decided to pick a picture of one of their most wanted

edit had requests about how to train this heres how

its all about the treats and praise what i do is i start by ringing the bell and giving a treat i do this for a while until i notice the dog has associated the sound with receiving a treat theyll lick lips or run over to the bell or something similar once they get it

then ill ring the bell but make them go outside to get the treat training them that bell rings then you go outside then you get a treat

then ill take their paw or snout and physically make them touch the bell then we go outside and they get a treat 

eventually theyll connect the dots bell  outside treats can be withdrawn as outside is a reward in and of itself running in the yard peeing chasing a squirrel etc

most people would agree that the idea of speaking in front of large groups of people can be terrifying and so we tend to avoid it whenever possible there are times however when we are faced with the task and theres no running away we must say a few words the following is a template for success which you can use when its your turn to speak in just about any type of gathering formal or informal 


1 the greeting

good

the greeting is the easy part you begin by simply wishing your audience a good morning afternoon evening or whatever time of day it is good evening everybody

2 state the event

as we all know

the second part is also very easy you simply state the obvious and remind everybody what the purpose of the event or celebration is and what youre all doing there as we all know were here to celebrate the marriage of john and kate and to show them our support as they begin their journey of love and life together now youve got the ball rolling and the words are coming out easily you look like you know what youre doing up there and people are listening so now its time to

3 establish common ground

weve all

its important to include your audience as part of the message youre delivering talk about something both yourself and your audience can relate to regarding the event or celebration weve all had the wonderful opportunity to get to know john and kate and enjoy watching their love develop

4 state why youre speaking

i

include a personal account or tell a brief story to let people know why you specifically are talking what gives you the right to be speaking ive personally been very lucky to have john as a close friend of mine and its been quite amazing to watch how hes grown as a person and couldnt be more pleased for him to have found someone like kate to go about his life with 

5 call for action

so lets all

finally close your speech with a call for action this lets everybody know that youre finished without you having to awkwardly say thats it or im finished thank youthat is how every weak speech is concluded and makes the audience uncomfortable you should say something like so lets all raise a glass to john and kate and wish them well cheers or so lets all give a big round of applause to mark for the outstanding job hes done while working with the company 


obviously there are many different ways these leading lines can be used but if you can commit them to memory and be prepared to use them next time you might be asked to speak you will let go of all fear and anxiety and people will be so impressed with your ability to get up and give a confident fluent speech in front of a group of people while looking like you didnt even have to prepare good luck and happy public speaking",1

475,6989f0,"paying for an home alarm monitoring service is a waste of money ive been investigating residential burglaries for over 10 years myself and every other cop i know does not pay for a burglar alarm monitoring service why you ask because most burglars are in and out in under 5 minutes the alarm company has to call the house then after they dont get an answer they call the police then the dispatch center has to get the details set up the call and dispatch an officer the quickest i have ever seen this process is about 810 minutes from the door being breached to an officer on scene 

if you want to make your house more secure you can do a few things that burglars notice a very large dog bowl at the front and back doors gets noticed even if you dont have a dog also burglars avoid detection at all costs very obvious camera placement is a very good deterrent also wifi doorbells that have two way communication work well there are many more but alarm monitoring is a waste of money

what the dealership had done was originally financed my car through the dealership for a lower interest rate then changed a lot of the finance numbers to ensure that everything matched for me in the short term ie my monthly payment but my interest rate jumped three percent i assume the commission for the salesman had jumped and they sold my contract to another finance company the numbers inside the contract including the final sale price of the car the trade in of my car additional warranty for mechanical issues the gap coverage and other miscellaneous dealership fees had changed dramatically to suit the needs of the finance contract to ensure that they could get the financing im now getting the paperwork from the finance company to ensure that what the dealership sent them matches what they gave me

tldr  dont sign anything without reading everything first and get all changes in writing which highlights all changes before signing a new contract from any dealership

edited to remove an assumption on commission

edit 2 for clarification  the dealership informed me during the first signing that i was approved through one finance company and had me sign the contract and idiotically my fault admittedly while letting the guy talk to me through the signing and not paying attention to what i was reading what i was actually signing was financing through the dealership the error was that in the 12 days between the first and second signing they had actually sold my contract from their dealership to the finance company that i was already approved for or that they had informed me i was approved through so the second contract was the exact same form as the first but the interest rate many of the numbers were different as well as the finance company had changed from the dealership to the finance company they had already informed me i was approved through",1

516,6fdljr,"15 years repairing electronics here with liquid damaged electronics dont use rice instead use a fan explanation inside ive spent nearly 20 years repairing liquidwater damaged electronics more specifically cell phones in the old days wed open the phones up clean the corrosion resolder etc recently theyve the manufacturers moved away from local repairs and moved more towards warranty replacements swap outs fru  factory replacement units  insurance now if you want your electronics repaired locally you have to visit 3rd party independent people since you can no longer have it done in a corporateran store

i know rice is the goto recommendation for water damaged phones and other electronics and it works to an extent it will passively absorb moisture unfortunately you dont want to passively absorb the moisture you want to actively remove the moisture as quickly as possible  the longer the moisture is sitting on those circuit boards the higher the risk of corrosion and corrosion on electrical components can happen within just a few short hours if the damage isnt severe wed take contact cleaner essentially 92 or better rubbing alcohol the higher the percentage the quicker it will evaporate and scrub the white or green powder the corrosion that formed with a toothbrush to remove it if that corrosion crosses contacts it can cause the electronics to act up fail or short out the liquid itself almost never is directly responsible for failed consumer electronics its the corrosion that takes place after the fact or the liquid damaging the battery a new battery fixes this issue obviously 

every time i see someone recommend rice i kinda twinge a little inside because while it does dry a phone out slightly better than just sitting on a counter it really doesnt do much to prevent the corrosion thats going to be taking place due to the length of time the liquid has had to fester inside the phone or whatever 

what you want to do is set the item in front of a fan with constant airflow take the device apart as much as you can without ruining it remove the battery etc so that the insides can get as much airflow as possible even if its not in direct contact with the air the steady air blowing over the device will create a mini vacuum effect and pull air from inside its just a small amount but its significantly better than just allowing the rice to passively absorb the evaporated moisture true rice can act as a desiccant but a fan blowing over whatever is orders of magnitude faster 

i personally will take apart a piece of electronics completely and put those items in front of a fan and if you have the relevant knowledge i highly recommend doing so as well but if you dont its not that big of an issue what you want to avoid at all costs however is heat do not put your phone inside an oven or hot blow dryer heat can damage electronics just as bad as liquid sometimes more so heat extreme cold and liquid are bad for electronics  cell phones a fan lots of airflow is 99 out of 100 times better at removing moisture quickly than rice i would say 100 out of 100 but im sure theres going to be some crazy situation or exception i havent thought of that someone will come in and point out id like to remind people that exceptions are just that they dont invalidate the rule ",1

turkey thaws at a rate of 34 lbs a day edit thaw in the fridge bottom shelf on a cookie sheet so a 21 lb bird needs to start thawing now to be ready for thanksgiving note drips from the turkey can contaminate food below

other turkey tips 

 dont stuff a bird for best results stuffing stops the air in the cavity from cooking the bird and makes it so the outside must be overcooked to get the inside to a safe temperature  

 a safer alternative to stuffing that still enhances its flavor butterfly the turkey and cook it on a bed of stuffing  this will reduce cooking time look at a few recipes to get a feel for how long it takes

 if you have to thaw a turkey quickly keeping it in cold running water for a few hours will work however this method take more work can add another unknown time element if done the day of wastes water and i dont think the end results are a good as a slow thaw  

 avoid recipes that cook at 350f or higher for the duration i cook my 1822lb bird at 250f for about 3 hours then go up 400f for about an hour edit apparently alton browns method starts high then goes low so there are other ways

 use a probe meat thermometer to tell if the turkey is done white meat should be be 165f maximum after resting the bird will continue to cook so pull it 10f earlier and dark meat 180f apparently 170175 for dark meat is recommended by cooks illustrated

 while there are minor differences between brands almost all frozen turkeys are the same i always get the cheaper store brands the only real differences are between kosherorganicseasoned
 edit dont baste or open the door to peek its more important to maintain a constant temperature with a higher temp near the end the bird will brown very nicely

536,59sbd5,"if adopting an animal from a shelter expect a few initial behavioral issues this is in no way acting as a discouragement ive spent the last 10 years in some sort of animal rehabilitation and shelter volunteering and it breaks my heart to see how often animals get returned after a few days because hes just not adjusting

in many cases the animals ive personally worked with have been rescued from abuse malnourished or strays volunteers work very hard and have several guidelines as to what makes and animal ready for adoption the top 5 complaints ive seen in my experience are

my new dog keeps going to the bathroom in the house first thing to consider in this situation is where was the animal living while at the shelter some shelters may keep their animals in runs or cells and often these animals dont get walked that creates a habit of the animal being used to using the bathroom inside proactive walking really helps correct this problem take your dog out often in the first few weeks and then start to dial it back gradually 

our kitty was so friendly and playful at the shelter now she just hides all day i dont think that were connecting your kitty was so happy and playful because she was somewhere she was accustomed to imagine you may have shared a room with a friend had a set schedule all of a sudden you were taken probably put in a cardboard box also dont leave cats in cardboard carriers cats are sensitive to over heating and it could have life threatening implications bring your own well ventilated carrier when adopting went for a scary ride and were dumped out into a strange environment alone and away from everyone you knew give kitty time shell get into a rhythm with you the best thing you can do right now is provide a clean litter box fresh water and proper feeding at set times dont drag kitty out from under the bed this only enforces the need to find a better spot to hide

new fido does nothing but bark nonstop all day first off this complaint usually comes from apartment dwellers if youre adopting a dog make sure beforehand that your lease allows pets dont just get a dog then when your land lord shows up to say you have to get rid of it claim that its a service dogyour just watching it for a friend fido is alone fido used to be in a place where there was a lot of commotion and all this silence is weird hooman where did you go dogs are pack animals and when theyre alone they feel vulnerable long walks and playtime before you have to leave for an extended period of time are good remedies to this leave a tv on on a low volume to shield all the scary outside noises in my personal experience crate training was a great tool but dont get one too big or too small big enough to stand up without ducking the head and and turn around in this method was recommended to me by my vet and just happened to work but it may not work for you professional consultation about a dogs excessive barking habits is never a bad idea all relationships take work

why does my new pet act so lethargic they were so full of energy when we first met its what i liked about her what are you feeding her is it the same food she was eating at the shelter sudden changes in diet can trigger upset tummies and more negative consequences food changes should be done gradually consult your vet on the best way to do this if they start showing signs of stomach upset it also has to do with the stress of being in a new environment all these knew sights and smells are exhausting to process

our new pet doesnt get along with our existing ones this one is huge how would you feel if your so roommate brought home some guy named chad and was like oh yea chad lives here now dogs even though theyre pack animals and cats can be very territorial this behavior may have only shown up when you caught kitty hair standing on end making those hilarious guttural meowing noises kitty doesnt understand that this new kitten is pet of the family now and not the evil outdoor neighbor cat even though youre in the same household introductions should be done gradually giving each animal an opportunity to sniff and item that has the others scent on it allowing them to sniff though doors etc if your bringing a new dog home to your existing dogs consider taking them to a dog park or anywhere fenced in thats not your house this gives them the chance to interact and also escape each other if they feel really threatened and its not on territory that your dog may be trying to defend make sure interactions are positive this doesnt mean that they get along every time but that the animals get praise for not being aggressive

hope this helps some people navigate the first few days of shelter pet adoption  and ps theres probably a bunch of typos

commercial pizzas are baked in stone ovens that get up to 700 1000 degrees which is why they bake so quickly and end up with nice crispy crusts and unburned everything else your home oven will never get that hot but you can try to get as close as possible to emulate the effect 

cook the pizza on the bare rack to maximize air circulation if you dont have a pizza stone or a cast iron skilletslab if you have either of those heat it in the oven first and then cook the pizza on that once the oven hits its max temperature 

for even better pizza brush the crust with olive oil before you bake and sprinkle either fresh garlic or garlic powder on it the garlic flavor helps to balance out the usually heavy handed and far too sweet sauce that goes on your average frozen pizza

this can be manipulative but if youre managing a team of people with a lot less experience than you it can be tempting to map out every aspect of how they do a job some jobs are highly complex and timesensitive and have to be done a certain way wherever possible find areas where people working under you can make choices or use initiative safely they are more likely to take pride in what theyre doing and take ownership of the task if they have some measure of input



edit some commenters seem to be missing the even if in the title im not saying manipulate people all the time where possible give them genuine scope for initiative and genuine choices if necessary and without being too obvious about it manufacture choices people work well with structure too much and youre micromanaging too little and youre giving up control good managers should avoid these two extremes",1

this is actually the second time something like this has happened to me the first time was when i was working for this parking enforcement company one of the perks was that when i was offduty id be able to park in companyrun lots without paying and if i got ticketed id just turn it over to my boss to void at the end of the week one day i got a ticket for a car that wasnt mine and pointed it out to my boss thinking that the lotchecker that day must really suck at his job my boss says i know what this is and explains to me that sometimes people will try to get out of paying a ticket by leaving it on the windshield of another car hoping that the other driver will pay it without noticing it wasnt for them he said this is one ticket i wont be voiding  lets let them have fun with our collections department what killed me the most about that one was that the car it was for was a brand new bmw convertible and i was driving a 20yearold mazda that showed all the signs of having been the car that two siblings and i had first learned to drive in in the absence of any other evidence im forced to assume the bmw belonged to donald trump

576,4zuctz,"when overloaded at work ask your boss to help you prioritize your tasks even if you already know what the priorities are in this case overloaded is synonymous with deadlines will be missed  overloaded does not mean im extra stressed this week so with that being said

telling your boss you are overloaded can bring with it negative connotations such as you are bad at prioritizing bad at time management or just slow  in other words their first reaction is likely to be that youre just complaining and not stating a fact 

a more tactful way is to do as i said above  create a list of all your major tasks and prioritize them then go to your manager and ask them to verify the priorities as you have outlined without saying that you are overloaded

this lets them see on paper that you have a lot on your plate this also lets them know you are thinking ahead and that you are practicing prioritization skills this also lets them take some responsibility for when you miss a deadline on a task because you both agreed it was a lower priority in doing this you avoid the questions and criticism for missing a deadline plus your manager now serves as a first line defense they will be ready to defend you because they know why you missed a deadline and they were part of the process that led to that happening

i speak from experience a year ago this burned me i missed a deadline because i never conveyed how taking on a new higher priority task forced me to postpone work on another major project when the deadline came hell rained down on me because i did not convey to my superiors that i had to keep pushing my project out to work on higher priority items they were blindsided when i missed my deadline and i was blindsided by how disappointed they were with me

the real here is as your priorities change make sure your boss knows how that impacts your other tasks and the deadlines associated with them

this can be a daunting project if you have a ton of photos but its very rewarding too you can instantly make your friends and familys faces light up as they see your photos and remember the old days

watching someone go from walking to being in a wheelchair all of the time usually results in one thing their overall health rapidly diminishes for example i have one gentleman who refused physical therapy and refused to walk after an injury this gentleman went from being a spry 50 year old to looking like he was 80 years old in a matter of six months it is also not uncommon to see people sit down in a wheelchair for good and ultimately go to hospice within a year 

if you have somebody that you love that is aging encourage them to walk if they can take them places even if its a burden walk with them hire a companion to walk with them encourage your family to help them stay active in my experience there is one thing that people who make it into their seventies and eighties and beyond have in common and that is that they keep moving

edit thanks for the gold  elder affairs are something im really passionate about so if anyone else wants to give find your local public guardianship office and make a donation  these offices are state funded and often rely on grants and they work to assure that people that are unable to make decisions for themselves mostly elderly people are well taken care of and get the services they need 

if thats too much work theres always meals on wheelshttpswwwmowaaorgdonate who do an extremely incredible service for elderly people all over the us

edit 2  just wanted to point out because im seeing a lot of this  elderly people can be a fall risk and a fall could dramatically alter their health at an older age  dont take people who cannot walk well out for a walk  some time on a recumbent bike on the lowest setting heck even sitting in the chair and raising and lowering their legs could help immensely as a start  if you have a loved one who needs help getting back on their feet look for physical therapists to work with them dont try to do it yourself if you are untrained

631,3yis0k,"how to get the most out of googlesearch enginesboolean searches  additional tricks  long post but have always found it very useful for general  specific searches this is my first attempt at a proper so please go easy on me im sure this will be very basic to some people but hoping others would find this very useful 

wow my first gilded post thanks mysterious person hope this proved useful for you

a few years back ive no idea how long ago to be honest i discovered in some computer magazine that there exists these hidden tricks within google to get the best out of their search engine and have been pretty much doing it ever since then

this will be a somewhat long post i imagine but only because theres a lot there

the various things ill be covering will be boolean searches  this wikipedia articlehttpsenwikipediaorgwikiboolean_algebra goes into it in greater detail than i will be as ill be keeping this as basic as possible and as basic as i know it and various other tricks

boolean searches

as mentioned earlier im really not going to go into this in a huge amount of detail especially regarding what is going on behind the scenes because i genuinely dont know that

for google searches the ones id use the most are or and not and was included in this but now i believe that google recognizes any space as an and function these always need to be entered in all caps otherwise google doesnt recognize them as operators

or would be used when you want to search for multiple variations on something essentially and brings back all the searches it finds imagine youre looking for motorbikes from all over but you know theyre referred to motorbikes and motorcycles in different places an example of a search youd use would be

motorbike or motorcycle

this will return all the pages it finds that used either the word motorbike or motorcycle within their text i believe that you can also use the character  making it motorbikemotorcycle but i think both works equally as well

not is how you would get rid of search results that you know arent at all useful to you i would usually use the minus sign  as opposed to writing not i would usually place this at the end of my search string but im not 100 sure if it matters im sure someone will confirm if this is the case

to continue the example from earlier youre searching for a motorbike but for whatever reason it keeps bringing up results for some knockoff brand well make one up and call it kavasaci you absolutely dont want this at all so your search string would look like this

 motorbike or motorcycle kavasaci 

make sure theres no space between the minus sign and the word you want to remove this will remove all the search results that mention this particular brand

boolean searches are more or less covered now so ill move on to other tips and tricks  ill be ignoring the motorcycle example from earlier and using ones people might actually use frequently

site

we all know that many sites have an absolutely awful internal search engine which is either basic as hell is too confusing to figure out or just doesnt work whatsoever you can combat this by using site followed by the url of the site you want to search for without the www ill give some small examples below but it is only really limited to the amount of websites that are searchable through google

siteredditcom

siteredditcomrlifeprotips

sitelinkedincom

what this is pretty much doing is telling google to search this very specific website ignoring every other site

 

quotation marks are extremely useful in google searches because it tells the search engine to search for the exact word order and phrase within them

as mentioned earlier google recognizes a space as and which will return any site that mentions all of the keywords within it lets take this example youre trying to look for a song that you heard on the radio but you only gleamed maybe one line and the dj refuses to name the song if you were to type the lyric into google like this

mama just killed a man

it might return a load of results that happened to contain all of these words  maybe a sentence like 

mama just went to the shop back then i would have killed for a cup of tea i saw someone coming towards me and i realized it was a man

to combat this youd use quotation marks around the exact phrase you know that you want to find

mama just killed a man

this has been a very basic view on how to use google a lot of these can be applied to most search engines to give one last practical example lets say youre looking for a new job whose description lists your skills using linkedins search engine well use or  not this will be an example to show looking for specific skills and other keywords that would be useful

you might look for  

html or javascript or php media or internet or online media or digital media internship trainee

you might notice above that there is a space between php and media this is taking advantage of the fact that the search engines recognize the space as and it is being told that youd like it to return all results that mention any of the keywords from html to php but also any that mention from media to digital media this can be useful for finding very specific jobs 

it will also get rid of any results that will mention internship and trainee

and there we have it a very basic view on how to use google and other search engines to find very specific things when it is required

a lot of this has been gleaned from the people over at boolean black belthttpbooleanblackbeltcom which while geared towards sourcing talentrecruiting can be very useful for learning new tricks

if you have any questions let me know im sure someone will tell me i misunderstood some concepts and ill most certainly update this if thats the case

637,2mg2ok,"use the extension html5 at the end of any youtube video to make it load as html5 instead of flash much more efficient at loading videos and plays back more effectively or use httpswwwyoutubecomhtml5 to automatically make all videos htlm5 

last updated february 17 2015  1100 pm



note every video should automatically play in html5 format however the occasional video may slip through and play as flash that is why i provided the tip to make an individual video html5

ie



flash httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtmeojfno6do



html5 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtmeojfno6dohtml5



fun facts about html5 on youtube

 you can playback the video in 025x 05x 1x 125x 15x and 2x speed

 some users may experience an issue where you cant always get full hd videos depending on the browsers

 videos load more efficiently and will keep loading until the end you can also go to any point in the video without having to wait for the video to reload videos will load slower in the background to make room for other bandwidth activities such as games streaming ect

 going into fullscreen automatically sets the video to 720p when minimized it reverts back to what ever the previous resolution was without having to reload it meaning you can have an entire video loaded in 360p or 240 go to fullscreen in 720p it will have to load and when you click out of fullscreen the original 360p will continue playing without the need to reload the rest of the video also works if you are in fullscreen and select the previous resolution that will play the fully loaded version in fullscreen without having to wait again 

 works with embedded videos on other nonyoutube sites automatically d 

 general use for both flash and html5 press m to mute the audio

 the snake game easter egg does not work in html5

 with both flash and html5 press j to rewind 10 seconds k to pauseplay and l to skip ahead 10 seconds

 press the leftright arrow keys to skim across the video by a few seconds dependant on the key direction

if you have to rent a different place for whatever reason has happened to me 3 times now due to job change and an iffy landlord situation you dont have to worry about changing your billing address or contact other institutions which have your address on file youre less likely to lose important mail between moves

if youre living with roommates you dont have to worry about them snooping through your mail

having a secure place to receive your mail may reduce your chances of being a victim of identity theft you can go out of town for several days and your mail is still safely locked at the post office

it might give you some comfort knowing that your physical address isnt on file with a bunch of organizations or businesses there are some limitations to this where you have to give someone your physical address not a mailing address

edited to add i had no idea id get such a big response to this a couple thoughts based on the comments here

as several folks have pointed out its probably a better idea to get a ups box especially if you buy a lot of stuff online i dont and i feel like my po box has suited me well

if you do decide to get a po box itll be the most worth it if the following conditions exist

1 you get a relatively low volume of mail meaning you dont have to check your box often

2 you end up moving frequently within the same metro area

3 the cost to rent the po box is reasonable some cities may be as low as 50 others will be as high as 150

clothing
edit ukanadakid19 posted some great backgroundhttpswwwredditcomrlifeprotipscomments3u9el0lpt_staying_warm_and_safe_this_winter_advice_fromcxdam9o info in regards to clothing and fabric choices 

layers always dress in layers and bring layers with you not only do layers create more pockets of air which help insulate but also allow you to avoiding sweating which will cool you off the fastest this also goes for your legs it might not be sexy but long underwear or tights underneath your pants will make an enormous difference high end winter gear creates this by design downfur  try to mimic this functionality with your layers 

edit generally you will have three

1 baselayer thermalslong underwear merino wool is go to here but there are many highperforming synthetics should you find it too pricey this layer should be quite tight and extremely softcomfortable and breathable it also needs to maintain warmth when wet because this is the one thats going to get sweaty which is bad but prepare for it anyway semirelated tip make sure that the combination of your socksthermals doesnt cut into your skin you often see this with ski and hiking boots if you have high quality socks consider getting thermals that only go down to midcalf  
2 midlayer on super cold days this can actually be two layers a breathable fleecesynthetic sweatshirt type layer see the arcteryx shirt i linked in the cotton section and an insulation layer which is not really breathable the insulation layer will almost always be some form of down and will be integrated into heavy parkas for this layer im really loving the new synthetic downhttpwwwpatagoniacomusshopwomensinsulationsyntheticinsulationk1e6vay its so light and squishy and easy to store when you need to which is awesome because this is likely the first layer that youll want to store 
3 the windwaterproof layer aka the shitty weather layer ok its actually called the outer layer or shell this is where youll spend the big bucks but in a pinch a goddamn plastic bag is better than nothing this layer is stopping windchill and rain only and often youll keep the lighter midlayer  this one after you get halfway down your run or to work or whatever  

loose do not restrict your circulation especially on your appendages feetfingers yes that extra pair of socks might seem like a great idea but if you have to squish into your boots i promise that your feet will be colder same goes for gloves mitts are usually better for that reason but uleonemean reminds us to make sure you tuck in your long underwear you are trying to create little sealed bubbles of air between you an the cold kind of like a thermos  

cotton is the worst jeans shirts dress pants whatever if it isnt wool or synthetic it will get wet stay wet and provide very little insulation even when dry and zero protection from the wind avoid at all costs edit smartwool and merino wool are the latest go to especially for baselayers but my favourite midlayer is this hoodiehttparcteryxcomproductaspxlanguageengenderwomenscategorymid_layer_and_fleecesubcatathleticmodelthaleiahoodyw i wear it almost every day especially after working out its great because it still lets the sweat evaporate but without letting you get cold



behaviour

1 protect yourself from the wind yes cover your earsfaceexposed skin with clothing toquescarfmitts but also stand in whatever shelter available and walk next to buildings to avoid the wind its a myth that you lose more heat from your head than any other body part but that doesnt mean that you shouldnt cover it like you would any other body part my father always told me you dont need to cover all your extremities just the ones you want to keep
2 make the most of the heat you have get dressed inside and wait for all the little pockets of air to warm up before you go outside 
3 do not get wet either from sweat or anything else getting wet will give you hypothermiafrostbite in minutes vs hours if you feel yourself starting to sweat immediately take off a layer or two whatever it takes if its slushy youre usually better off with 20 gumboots and a good pair of socks rather than nonwaterproof boots 

edit im seeing a lot of posts saying but but i sweat when i wear and then im cold 

sweating is caused by two things

1 the breathability of the fabrics youre wearing this can be rectified largely by spending more money on slightly looserphysically lighter more insulating items that wick away moisture and yes it is possible to get breathable waterproof winter boots if you spend enough money and do not cheap out on your socks either try cheap alternatives first but the technology is there if you need an extreme solution 
2 you arent removing or wearing your layers appropriately in order to stay warm your toes fingers and arms should all be able to moverest freely and comfortably if that movement is hampered say you cant reach in front of you or over your head likely you have the wrong clothing on when you step outside you should feel a slight chill that goes away when you start moving once you get moving its very normal to only have your windwaterproof shell and your long underwear on and there have definitely been times where i skied in long underwear and snowpants and removed my coat completely  



frostbite

recognize the symptoms 

 stages lethargy in your jointshttpswwwredditcomrlifeprotipscomments3u9el0lpt_staying_warm_and_safe_this_winter_advice_fromcxd6bun pain and numbness and youll notice some freaky colour changes pain is good numbness is not but likely youll have a tough time noticing which parts are numb and which just hurt if you start feeling pain you should do something about it if you see blue there is likely some tissue damage you need to get out of the cold immediately  

 treatment understand that while you feel pain the surface area of your skin is completely numb you will have no reliable feedback as to what is actually hurting you you can try rubbing the area but you will not be able to tell if youre damaging the skin you can try to warm it up with water but you likely will not be able to tell what temperature the water is it is very easy to burn or damage your skin further while it is in the early stages of frostbite and are trying to warm up 

and it will hurt a lot  just be patient and wait 

hypothermia

understand that most cases of hypothermia happen without and snow or frost because people are not prepared pouring rain at 45f8c can be just as deadly 

recognize the symptoms 

 the shiveringteeth chattering stops 
 you start to feel sluggishslow 
 its hard to think you almost feel drunk 
 and then you feel very very sleepy and not really cold at all

treatment obviously get out of the cold and get warm if this isnt immediately easily available do the following

 get dry change your clothes and try to dry the wet ones
 get out of the wind build a shelter crawl under to the base of a tree and the elements
 find a source of heat even a candle in a small shelter or your car can make a huge difference do not leave your car running because you wont notice if your exhaust becomes blocked and starts filling your car up with carbon monoxide 


emergency preparedness

first and foremost always tell people where you are going your anticipated route and when youll arrive obviously unnecessary in busy city centres but for those commuting long distances or taking trips over winter this is a good lifesaving habit to get into 

keep this  minimal  emergency kit in your car at all times and all seasons

 windproofinsulated gloves  toque
 rain ponchos
 plastic bagsgarbage bags they are windproof and decent for keeping your feet and core dry in a pinch
 emergency blanket and sleeping bag if possible
 candle  matchesmeans to light it
 reflective cones and glowsticks or flares if possible
 multitool letherman 
 first aid kit
 energy bars
 an old school accurate paper map of the area

edit u8654 reminded me of a few i missedhttpswwwredditcomrlifeprotipscomments3u9el0lpt_staying_warm_and_safe_this_winter_advice_fromcxd9og3context3 but keep in mind this is a basic kit if you live in more remoteextreme areas you need a lot more than what ive listed  

 a tow rope
 salt or sand or kitty litter

and when the worst happens understand that not all survivalemergency situations are created equal 

 it may or may not be safest to stay in your vehicle generally speaking you will survive the elements longer if you wait in your car
 but if your car is anywhere near a major highway youre also more likely to get hit
 but even then its still safer to get hit while in your vehicle rather than crossing the road on foot this recently ended in a terrible tragedy for a canadian politician trying to help a stranded motoristhttpwwwcbccanewscanadacalgarymanmeetbhullarrememberedprenticefawcettnenshi13334178

701,4aiend,"in a notatfault automobile accident you are entitled to a check for the value that your car lost due to the collision but youll only get it if you ask for it a car that has been patched up is worth less than a car that is clean this is better known as diminished value any damage to your vehicle is recorded under the vin and when it comes time to resell your car people will pay less for it insurance companies acknowledge this but they wont mention diminished value to you your own insurance company probably wont mention it either since it isnt their responsibility to pay it out youll only get it by asking

heres the process

1 give your side of the story to the other persons insurance company like normal but make a note of the namenumber for the agent you spoke to

2 wait until the insurance companies agree on who is at fault that usually takes a couple of weeks and you can call your own insurance company for an update

3 call up the agent for the other insurance company and tell him you are pursuing diminished value depending on the size of the office theyll either send you off to someone else or theyll help you it helps to have their claim number as a reference

3 be courteous nothing is more irritating than nonlawyers impressing their legal rights on a customer service agent

4 answer their questions sometimes theyll send an agent to inspect the car after its been fixed sometimes they wont but in 310 days theyll provide you an offer

5 accepting or declining the offer is up to you but once you arrive at a figure that is amenable to both sides you sign a document waiving your right to sue the insurance company for this collision once they have that they mail you a check


one phone call but guess what happens if you dont make that phone call nothing

my personal examples

vehicle hyundai tucson

estimated value before collision 1765000

damage rear ended most of the trunk had to be replaced

cost to repair 176500

diminished value offer 88250


vehicle hyundai tucson

estimated value before collision 1595000

damage tboned in an intersection side of car replaced and frame had to be corrected

cost to repair 327500

diminished value offer 130000


edit i should really note that this has nothing to do with negotiating the value of a totaled car everyone knows you can do that and it wouldnt be much of a life pro tip this is about negotiating how much less your car is worth now that it has been in an accident  and getting a check for that amount",1

many boxes unfortunately get damaged daily boxes do get tossed and get crushed under the weight of other boxes this season gets really busy for shipping so timely service can get chaotic in warehouses

remember to
 pack as tight as you can try to make sure no contents shift around inside boxes use anything you can find as filler
 use a sturdy box that wont get crushed under a good amount of weight boxes are stacked by making walls weak boxes will cave 
use plenty of tape so many boxes open contents do fall out because people actually think a single strip of tape will work you can never use too much tape guys and gals
 please remove any other barcodes besides the actual shipping label this is so package handlers dont get confused as well as the automated sorting machines 
make sure the address is correct packages get scanned for your tracking updates if the address is wrong it will read as an error

711,4dgm1f,"use baby powder to easily remove sand after a day at the beach living near the beach i thought this was common knowledge but seems that lots of people dont know how well baby powder will get sand off your body 

just sprinkle it wherever needed and rub around  the powder absorbs the excess moisture and releases the sand  rinsing sand off with water leaves you wet and attracts more sand   seriously the powder works really well and leaves little residue if you do it right 

works great for young kids  way better than trying to rinse it off while they fight you or not rinsing and having sand tracked in to your car or house plus as a parent you might have some baby powder with you anyway 

edit  ive received way too many replies that baby powder causes cancer  i had not heard of this risk before so i did about two minutes of research and discovered that there might be a notyet proven link between talc and increased cancer  so im not personally concerned but feel free to do some reading or just dont use this tip your call 

you could probably also use corn starch instead of baby powder to remove sand but i havent tried it  ive already devoted too much time to this simple tip so just do whatever you like best 

edit 2  i just checked my baby powder and its all cornstarch no talc so thats means 1 cornstarch does work and 2 talc free baby powder is easy to find  so stop with the cancer messages

yes you may be perfectly healthy but you never know what day will be your last worst case scenario you die tomorrow but your children will have a final message to watch and listen to best case scenario you will live for decades to come and your children and grand children will love to watch this video of a younger you talking to them from the past

734,4wnjwo,"if you ever feel like making a decision when in high emotion wait 24 hours before committing to the action my mom taught me this rule when i young and i have lived by it ever since  everyone has been in a situation where their emotions are high and immediately create an idea of action in order to solve the issue  for example your boyfriend pisses you off and you decide that the best idea is to call him to bag him out  or youre excited about a new car test drive or seeing a new gadget take my money amazon purchase etc and you immediately decide to purchase it  

its amazing to see how your brain can process your choice of action over the 24 hours  when the emotions settle you think more cognitively and can decide responsibly without the influence of your strong emotions from the initial creation of your idea

however hearing his voice knowing now i cant call him back or ever hear it in person again is sacred it brings me to tears listening to them but it also instantly puts a smile on my face i think everyone should take some time whether its once for a few minutes or biweekly sessions to record some type of message for their loved ones the important part doesnt have to solely be in which words you say but rather in the fact that you are saying them todays technology makes this extremely easy

revenge is cheap and worth perhaps a little vindictive pleasure but ultimately it is likely to hurt you in the long run people talk your superiors are better connected than you are and word gets around fast dont burn bridges unless you absolutely have to 

real life example last year i was fired from my job for the worst reason  underperformance i sat down in front of both directors and had them tell me in no uncertain terms this was an incontrovertible decision i was angry i felt wronged my situation was complicated and they werent hearing my side however i listened to what they said discussed a few points and at the end of the meeting thanked them for the opportunity shook hands and calmly explained to them everything theyd need to do to hand over my accountspasswords etc

doing this ended up with being able to put one of those directors down as a reference which in turn has helped secure a new position for a great company ive heard that he was especially complimentary towards me

762,4sbxhk,"before buying something expensive online take a screenshot of the confirmation price i could also post this as a tifu

i just purchased an airline ticket with a travel agency flight network only to be charged 250 more than the actual ticket price i only realised later when i checked my credit card statement to clarify the confirmation screen showed about 650 but when the charges and receipt came through i was charged 900 i also messed up by not carefully checking the receipt 

i made the calls amex will not do anything without evidence and neither will the travel agency do whatever you wanna do were not fixing this is what the agency said 

a corollary to this is never ever pay off your credit card without verifying the charges because i was often paying off my card immediately based on my quoted purchase price not what they actually charged me it implies consent to the purchases

never buy anything from flightnetworkcom

i hope you guys and gals can learn from my mistakes 

further thoughts

the current ticket price close to departure is about 700 its obvious that i was overcharged because international flights only go up closer to departure date all sources on flights online indicate this if what i charged was legitimate how couldve the price dropped by 22




edit as upjp2000 points out the bigger buy from the airlines directly instead other places ive posted this experienced travellers suggest the same in my experience however ive gotten significantly cheaper deals going through agencies instead of directly through airlines so i dont know it depends in the level of risk youre willing to take 



update its only fair i do this update theyve given me a credit of approximately the equivalent amount to be used with them in the future

766,4q3uvu,"use focus sessions and day goals to stay productive at work httpiimgurcomrzwfiskjpg

tldr the link above shows a set of techniques ive implemented as part of my 2016 new years resolution and stick with each day

more descriptions of each section below 
______

 date

 time at desk goal get in as early as possible since morning hours are most productive for me tracking this by writing it down helps give a tiny surge of motivation each morning



 day goals these are intended as a few overarching goals lets say 23 goals for what would make the day successful to you it helps immediately scope the days goals a critical step after you write these down think if at the end of the day i accomplish these 3 things will i feel good about today if that thought leaves you feeling like your day goals are too daunting or too insufficient then revise them before actually starting the day repeat until you feel comfortable with day goals



 morning thoughts i was finding that id come in with a set of emotionally charged thoughts that would then distract me throughout the day taking a few minutes to write down whatever happens to be on my mind whatever i happen to be feeling really helps to clear it or at least postpone the thoughts for when i actually want to make time to process them



 todo list this todo list at least for me is not a comprehensive list of all work items instead it contains things like chores meetings social things smaller menial tasks email checking etc the idea is to give myself less mental credit for a menial task and more credit for working towards my day goals while still recognizing the need to get the menial tasks done



 retrospective how did i actually use my time every couple of hours i update this list with where my time actually went its been super interesting in particular to see how what sometimes might feel like a quick afternoon break to me was actually more like a 2 hour break or something has been very revealing and sometimes helps me with efficiency



 focus sessions these things are magical at least for me my big realization is that previously id reason that eg sending a quick text message takes all of 20 seconds and is no big deal but in reality i was simply not creating the sort of totally focused absolutely uninterrupted time i needed to get things done for real so focus sessions are 12 hour periods set the time just before you begin one where all social media goes off completely not even one exception no text messaging no facebook no reddit ideally no email for 12 hours write down your work goal for the focus session focus sessions have been mind clearing and liberating for me and they are short enough to stick with when the focus session is over you are again free to kick back and catch up on texts its fun if youve accumulated some i try to do anywhere from 36 of these a day and personally find that about 15 hours is a good length of time during focus sessions i listen to music designed to enhance focus such as alpha waveshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwpni755krg but whatever music works well for you is fine i find its good to have an auditory trigger that you gradually grow to associate with focusing if i am tempted to cheat i remind myself that i am specifically trying to prove that i have selftrust if i say i am going to focus for 15 hours i will selftrust works both ways though  if i say im going to have fun for an hour i should have stressfree fun

edit one more note on focus sessions  you dont necessarily need to work during the full focus session if i need a pause i find that staring out the window for a little while is a good quick rest that does not require a context shift 




hope these techniques ive developed to address my own productivity issues will help some other people too would be curious which parts of this work for other people as well

eventually my mind feels stressed and cluttered and it takes a toll on my ability to think and be productive like my mind is expending effort to remember so many little tasks
when i write everything down and i mean everything my mind feels a million times lighter because i can forget it all and let go  the thoughts are on paper not in my head so i dont have to remember them when i feel productive i just grab the list and knock some tasks off when new things come up i add to the list
its one of the very few things that genuinely helps my mind feel better and less stressed

773,6dhr6z,"caring what other people think about you is just part of being young the sooner you can learn to let go of your attachment to other peoples validation the sooner you begin to live your real life before retirement as a shy individual who spends a lot of my time beating myself up the number one thing i hear from people in their 50s if i tell them this about myself is this you remind me of a younger me 

point being caring what others think is just sort of programmed into the minds of the average young person but nobody really cares what others think about them by the time they reach their 50s they just dont theyve lived enough life to see that it literally serves no point but theyre the same person we are so attached to it that we feel like validation from our peers is literally essential to survival but it is not in any way whatsoever so many of the older people i talk to just say they feel the exact same as they did when they were in their prime just now they are in a 50 year old body

so for the love of god stop caring what others think of you find something you love put the horse blinders on and just do the shit out of what makes you happy there is absolutely no reason whatsoever that you need to care about how other people are perceiving you it is only causing you unnecessary stress at which nothing can be gained even if you think youre doing everything right to keep others happy losing battle

maybe your life has become so unconsciously centered around winning other peoples validation that you dont even know what im talking about you have a following and that keeps you going but you dont really know yourself that well youre going to be addicted to tangible destructive things when you get older gambling smoking drinking etc because you cant get anybody to care about what youre doing anymore because youre old now and nobody really cares about what youre doing or who you are minus maybe your immediate family if you have any i know that was a harsh sentence but the right people will know what im trying to get at youre one of the type of person that seriously needs help before its too late what you may think is socialization and healthy conversation with others about your life achievements and why youre definitely going to heaven is just your brain subconsciously trying to get a fix of selfvalidation off the person im going to make sure this person knows how amazing i am and then breathe a sigh of relief  like you just stuck a needle in your vein

point in summary just about everyone who gets past the age of 50 stops caring what others think about them because they finally see that it serves absolutely no purpose so if youre young take their advice get the ball rolling early its easier said than done but with a bit of courage you can make your path by walking were all made of the same thing so trying to keep everybody happy and constantly gaining reassurance that youre okay and everybody likes you is an addictive activity that serves zero purpose the sooner you can legitimately stop caring what others think about you and just listen to yourself and trust yourself and your true endeavors the sooner you have eliminated a toxic addiction from your body that will have bad longterm effects

801,80ujr0,"if you see a vehicle accident and dont want to or cant stop to help call 911 even if you think someone definitely must have called 911 already call 911 anyway you will probably be the firstonly person to call background so my family and i were recently in a very serious headon fatality collision on a highway luckily for us our phones were in our jacket pockets when it happened second dont keep your phones loose in your vehicle so when we came to on the side of the highway we were able to call 911 our car was mangled and we couldnt get the doors open so we were stuck inside but i could see through my side window as vehicle after vehicle after vehicle passed by us seriously there were over like 40 vehicles that passed by us 
after getting out of the hospital we were speaking with the police recently and something they said really struck me the only 911 call placed at all was from us not a single person stopped which i can somewhat understand when its dark and icy out but of all of those vehicles nobody even called 911 
if we had been knocked unconscious longer or if our phones had been wrecked in the crash we would have been stuck there for who knows how long my kid probably would have died he needed emergency surgery we could have ended up freezing or bleeding out it was really actually quite depressing when i heard that the only people who called it in were us 
so the next time you see an accident when driving just play it safe and call it in you could save a life

edit to clarify i want to state that yes i would much prefer for everyone to go and help if they witness an accident or emergency as well as call 911 that would 100 be preferable i was just trying to reach the absolute laziest scared ambivalent etc out there and say if you dont stop you should at least call 911 
if your countries laws require you to stop at an emergency and help then yes obviously do that

edit again its been brought up that if its just a minor thing like a fender bender that calling 911 can be a waste of time and resources i agree that this can occur and obviously you have to use your judgement stop and assess if you can as that will help with this but i still stand by my post that if you dont know its better to err on the side of caution and call

update 2  yoga is not bad yoga is good  sorry for the confusion there  i am not hostile towards yoga  at the time of the training yoga had surged in popularity and people were using it as a substitute for actual problem solving so the instructor used it as an example because it was a hot topic  yoga is good and does make you feel better and does relieve stress but its imperative to not rely on it solely for stress management  also others things like yoga working out etc are very good for clearing your mind and focusing  the instructor said he fed his animals he had chickens lol as a way to clear his head and reevaluate his pile of stressors  yoga is great for that as is going to the gym etc  it will temporarily relieve your stress and also allow you a calm time to make your list of stressors or even if need be forget about them for a while  but it is not a final solution to removing stressors from your life  so just to clarify yoga is good  i didnt mean to demonize it

update 3  thanks so much for the reddit gold  ive never gotten that so i have no idea what to do but its a great honor nonetheless  im just glad i could help if i was able to and also must give full credit to the instructor that taught me these lessons in the first place  i really wish id gotten his name so i could force him to go to every school and workplace to give the same briefing lol

long story short i was forced to go through stress management training during my enlistment given by an active duty fighter pilot  turned out to be the best training ive ever been through  i dont have his slides so my version will be the abbreviated one  also i have added some things like analogies and such that helped me understand things better  im going to fit the real meat and potatoes of the training into the first section then afterwards i might into more detailed descriptions of this or that  its gonna be long winded but if anything just get the middle section read and youll be good to go

stress management

stress is not a feeling an emotion a mood  stop treating it like one its a physical thing that happens to your body  its your body saying something is wrong fix it  symptoms of stressanxiety include things that can be measured by doctors such as weight gain lack of sleep blood pressure issues acne hair loss etc  many people try to treat stress as a feeling and do things to make them feel better like yoga workout have sex go to the gun range or buy little stress balls that they squeeze when they feel stressed  this is the incorrect way to deal with stress  

think of stress as financial stress  what is financial stress  you have too much to pay for and not enough money  if you were financially stressed and i told you i could make you feel better about it by selling you a squeeze ball for 20 bucks would you fall for that garbage  i hope not

this is how stress stacks up on your life  imagine a graph  there is an invisible line somewhere on it going straight horizontally all the way across  that is your personal stress threshold  literally everything that you have to do in your life is a stressor  imagine them as blocks stacking up on top of each other  some are bigger than others  the closer you get to your threshold the more stressed you feel  if you do not prevent them from crossing that threshold you will enter depression which is your body saying screw it you wont fix it ill just shut everything down until it works itself out much like how if youre freezing to death in the woods your body starts shutting down to save the vital organs but you will still eventually freeze to death anyways  think of stress as you shivering when its cold and depression as your body shutting down to preserve vital organs

so this is the way to manage stress  you manage it  the pilot giving the training said to make a list either mentally or literally of everything that stresses you out  next look at the list and see what you can actually take care of right then and there and start knocking things off the list  you will literally be removing stress from your life  you ever wonder why people say they feel like their load is lighter or weight has been lifted off their shoulders after they complete a task  because it has  ever wonder why people say they feel good after mowing the lawn or going to the gym or whatever  its because theyve actually removed a stress block from their life  theyve done something  often times people try to manage stress by drinking tea or doing yoga or doing things that simulate to their mind that theyre accomplishing something when really theyre just tricking their brain into releasing the chemical that it does when you actually get something done  the real way is to actually identify the things that stress you out and remove them from your pile of stressors  

when you make your list literally write out everything  pretty much if you think about something and say oh crap i have to do that its a stressor  everything from brushing your teeth in the morning to changing that light bulb in the laundry room to gassing up your car to studying for that test to outprocessing for that deployment to going to that job interview etc etc  write them down look at it and think oh shoot i could just change that lightbulb right now  i could mow the lawn  i could fix that door hinge  do this and you will be on your way to becoming more productive and less stressed  ive been doing this for years now and it works great  its how these fighter pilots manage their personal lives and flying a stupid fast war machine in combat  there have been a few times where i did still get too stressed out but it was because i literally just had too much on my plate that was beyond my control but since i understood how stress works i was able to still get ahold of it and break myself out of the slight depression i had slipped into



further notes

types of stress

residual stress aka emotional baggage  this type of stress cannot be eliminated or is very difficult to remove  it is things that have happened to you in the past that you drag with you forever  they feel like things you need to fix but since theyre locked in the past you cant do anything about them so they cause your stress pile to start out a little higher no matter what you do  you fell on your face that one time at school or your parents never loved you or you got stage fright that one time etc etc  some people have more than others and it just always eats at the back of your mind  i have found an awesome way to get over this but it is using my interpretation of the heathen worldview which is another tip for another time

reoccurring stress these are things that pop up on a reoccurring basis such as daily chores bills house or work maintenance etc  they are usually small stressors for people but since they pop up often theyre always needing to be removed anyways  people often shrug these off but they can sneak up on you  if you dont take care of the small things the big things will stack higher faster  ever heard the phrase the straw that broke the camels back  that straw was probably a reoccurring stressor

time sensitive stress  these are stressors that are hanging over your head but cannot be taken care of yet  your college finals  job interviews  upcoming vacation  etc  they are among the hardest for me to deal with because they are there  but you cant do them yet  the way to reduce their impact is to ensure you are knocking out the easier stress blocks in the meantime  change that lightbulb get your car serviced mail that package etc  another way is to recognize the precursors to that time sensitive stressor like studying for the college finals or preparing for the job interview  you will still be knocking things out being productive removing stress and will be better prepared for the tss when it does arrive

a note on depression

this part of the training has to basically alienate a specific group of people  if you are clinically depressed then this method may not help you manage your depression because your brain works differently  depression is where you havent removed enough stress blocks and so your body says screw it  the danger here is that it will remove your energy motiviation etc  by understanding this you will be able to get back in the saddle remove some stressors and get your life back under control  the pilotinstructor went deeply into the phases of depression and what is known as a psychotic break  depending on where you are in your depression when you hit your psychotic break you will lash out in a certain way  example if youre in inner you will hurtkill yourself  if youre in outer you will hurtkill someone else  but what makes it a psychotic break is that is will be completely bizarre  the example he used was brittney spears shaving her head vs the nasa officer who went to florida to kidnap her boyfriends lover  brittney spears had much less stress on her life yet she flew through all the stages of depression and basically hit her psychotic break at a point that caused her to just completely snap and shave her head  the nasa officer underwent a tremendously stressful entire life before finally lashing out at a person who made little to no impact on her overall life  it basically demonstrated how much some people can mentally endure compared to others and how failure to manage it can cause serious problems 

a story of my usage of this training

ill make it quick  i was a ssgt in usaf  i was in college full time also  i had orders to the desert  i was a crew lead at my base for my specific job  i had finals for college coming up  in that same week i had waps testing which is how usaf enlisted troops test for rank  its a big deal  i also had to outprocess for my deployment that week anyone in can attest to what a stupid pain in the ass that can be  i was super stressed and it got to be too much  but i understood how stress worked  i couldnt make my finals come sooner nor my waps test  outprocessing could be done during work hours  but i still had to lead my crew which entailed all kinds of bullcrap  so heres what i did  first thing first i told another nco on my crew listen man youre an nco you know the ropes youre the crew lead now  i literally just dumped part of my plate onto his but he was trainedqualifiedcapable of doing it and thats literally what he was there for was to lead the crew if i wasnt around  so i just made him the primary and i took the alternate slot  a huge stressor gone  next i ensured all my little stuff was taken care of such as chores honeydos around the house  after that i made sure i had a dedicated time for waps and college studying so that that stressor didnt bleed into my thoughts all the time  finally i made outprocessing my primary concern during the work day so no workrelated stressors could pile up  all i had to do was make appointments and knock things off a checklist  this literally saved me from becoming overwhelmed and let me make it through the ordeal  when it was all said and done i did great on my college finals i didnt make rank thats ok though the cutoff score was high for my career that year and i got to the desert and back in one piece  thanks random fighter pilot on instructor tdy

anyways i hope this helps someone  it has gotten me through a lot and i share it whenever i can  take care everyone       

tldr  dont think of stress as a feeling  treat it like financial stress  think of stress as physical blocks stacking up on your life  they key to keeping stress levels down is to remove the blocks  make a list of stress blocks and eliminate them  it will not just make you feel better it will make you better

841,2bb2ke,"make sure you have your carbon monoxide detectors in working order i almost just lost my family today my alarm went off at 5am this morning and i had a hard time getting out of bed i was extremely tired and had a lot of trouble keeping my balance i could hardly stand up and at one point i realized i was standing over the toilet with my toothbrush in the water and the toilet flushing i think i passed out and caught myself 

it completely messed with my thought processes and i didnt make rational decisions i thought i was having a heart attack yet still opted to drive to work and not tell my wife about it i remember looking at my lunch on the way out but not thinking to grab it then i went out and tried to put my keys in my wifes car then realized i forgot my lunch and on the way back from her car i realized it was her car all of this seemed normal under the effects of carbon dioxide monoxide poisoning 

i made it to work somehow 35 mile drive and 152 hours after work started at 6 i get a call from my wife saying she got up and could hardly stand and that she fell over in my sons room luckily she knew to get out of the house before calling me then had her mom pick her up 

i called my mom who is my landlord and she had the fire department out there by 9 and they walked in 2 feet and said the reading was 250ppm which is fatal had they woken up 2 hours later they would both be dead and i would probably kill myself 

we all went to urgent care and got cleared but both me and my wife have nasty dull headaches my 2 year old son is fine they werent worried about him at all him sleeping with his door shut may be what saved him there 

all of this could have been avoided had i had detectors when we moved it we got new smoke detectors then decided to get the carbon monoxide detectors a little down the road and now 2 years later realized we both completely forgot 

dont fall victim to something so easily avoidable get your detector if you dont have one and if you do check it every once in a while 

fyi the gas company came out and determined that it was the boiler slowly leaking over time that did it they shut it down and opened the windows and the levels are 0 i got 2 new detectors for my home too 

edit i didnt expect this to blow up but im very thankful for the kind words and especially glad that many of you have learned from my mistake and bought one for yourself 

my wife got a call back from urgent care who called poison control and they sent her and my son to the er for better blood testing  oxygen both have been sent home with normal levels in their system i was there too but the doctors felt i didnt need it because i had less exposure and seem normal and feel about 90",1
842,42ozli,"if a dogs owner tries to stop them from jumping on you begging for food from you etc dont insist that its fine and allowencourage the dog to keep doing it theyre trying to train it and youre really hindering the process final edit this is intended for those who go against the owners plain straightforward request that you not encourage the dog and those who never thought of it this way

and yes the same definitely goes for kids if theyre not yours dont teach them to do bad shit

sorry i left out what you should do instead you should disengage the dog altogether try to pretend shes not there until she does something good usually settle down sit whatever and then you can praise her or you know just listen to what the owner is telling youasking of you if you cant listen to a friends simple requests why the fuck do you have friends and no were not going to keep our dogs away from all human beings until theyre 100 trained the fuck are you thinking

this really isnt outlandish this is pretty common sense if you refuse to do this because you want to play with the dog however you want or you dont want to help the stupid owner that cant train the dog right that just makes you an asshole

its very sweet of you to not make a big deal of it when a dog does something undesirable like jump or beg and im sure all of us dog owners really appreciate it

but when you say oh no no no please its fine and hold your arms out to greetsupport the jump or just straight up feed them when they beg encourage the bad behavior what are you doing its their dog if they want to train him not to jump you should support that you are not signing a social contract by interacting with a persons dog but you shouldnt undermine them and ignore their request that you not encourage the bad behavior

encouraging the dog makes training really difficult and take much longer they tend to not learn okay i can jump with this one person but its bad with everyone else they just learn mom is mean and doesnt let me jump on her but everyone else loves jumps

843,4gdeqm,"how to get a cab if they keep denying you a ride due to your destination being to far away if youre in a nightlife area of a major city and need a ride to the suburbs or to city limits most taxi drivers will deny you a ride once you tell them your destination they want to stay in the areas with most business to maximize rides during peak hours so to get around this walk to nearest big hotel thats within this nightlife area and hail one of the cabs waiting out front you might have to enter the hotel from parking garage and exit through main lobby they have deals with the hotels to provide their guests rides and turning them down jeopardizes their permission to wait outside the hotel they will think youre a guest and comply no matter what your destination is 

if youre ballsy enough you can even ask a bellhop to hail a cab for you as long as youre exiting the lobby they will assume youre a guest and oblige and youll get a cab guaranteed 

edit this worked for me during mardi gras in new orleans years before ride sharing i saw someone mention uber was banned in their city so i thought this could help people in those cities or in cities during huge events where theres dozens of people wanting cabs so they have plenty of other people to give a ride with shorter and more profitable trips

uber lyft or any other ride sharing service is absolutely a better option if available in the area",1

i immediately thought about all of the shitty terrible things that people said to me or about me over the course of my life and how their words made me feel and the thought that i had made others feel that way without even realizing it  countless times  probably  completely struck me  

the thought that i could have caused a lifelong negative impact on someone and that they associate me as a person with some stupid thoughtless comment was a pretty big thing to take in  that i could have made fun of something completely indefensible about them causing them to feel insecure and lack selfesteem for something that they couldnt even help or control

and that was just thinking about actual inperson interactions without even considering all of the shit i said to people online in my younger days

what do you guys recommend i do should i talk to her about my difficulties in talking to any help would be appreciated

tldr there is this girl i like that is shy i want to get to know her better but im shy as well what do i do

edit i really didnt think this post would get any traction first time on the front page actually i didnt think i would have to use a throwaway account so hopefully the girl doesnt find out",1

29,89cl3t,"while playing a table game at a casino secretly pocket some of your own chips so that when you color out the pit boss marks you down as losing more money than you actually did and spending more money gets you more comps more casino tips inside keep in mind the dealers do have an idea of how much you actually lost so you cant go crazy with it also if they catch you doing it more than once they will tell the pit boss about it its not illegal or anything to take your own chips off your stack but they dont like people trying to lie about how much they won or lost when youre done at the table ask to color out and the dealer will exchange your chips for higher denomination ones so theyre easier for you to holdcarry they then call the pit boss over to look at the chips and make sure the dealer exchanged for the right amount this is when the pit boss sees what youre walking away with and marks down how much you won or lost

when you leave a table always cash your chips in at the cage before going to another table and then buy in with cash again at the new table so it appears that you are spending more in the casinos eyes if you sit down at a new table with chips from another table then youre not spending more money just the same money at a different table you want it to look like youre spending a lot the pit boss keeps track of how much you are buying in for each time you sit down at a table you always give them your players card when you sit down so they can put the info on your accountthey also keep track of how much you are wagering per hand but in my opinion its not worth it to wager more than youre comfortable with just to increase your comps you could end up losing a lot more money than what the comps will be worth

 its becoming more and more common for casinos in vegas to charge for parking but parking is free for people in the higher tiers of the players club people accidentally leave their players club cards in slot machines and if you can find a higher tier card someone lost you can use it at the parking ticket machine for free parking for a more ethical version simply ask someone if they can get an extra copy of their card made for you to use for this purpose its easy to get a card made up and many people have 2 or more you cant do anything else with it without knowing their pin so its pretty harmless you can also google which casinos offer free parking and see if theres one within walking distance to your destination

 if you want to watch a game or otherwise hang out in the sports book but dont want to pay ridiculous drink prices find out what their policy is for complimentary drinks for the people betting on horses a sports bet will get you one comp drink voucher but many casinos have a policy where horse players get free drinks without needing to use the drink vouchers this has something to do with horse betting being parimutuel the casino makes money whether you win or lose horse players also tend to spend a lot of money going to the window and betting before each race sometimes multiple tracks at once sit in the horse betting area turn your little personal tv to a racing channel get a racing program and find some losing wager tickets someone left around so it looks like youre betting horses and enjoy free drinks youll be able to see the sports from that area too you may have to place a bet on a race once in a while to keep the facade going but its still cheaper than paying full price for the drinks minimum bet on a horse race is 2 you would also get a free drink voucher when you make the bet if you ask politely they might give you two of them and who knows maybe your horse will win 

 when youre playing a slot machine or table game cocktail waitresses come around and serve complimentary drinks if you want a mixed drink such as vodka and cranberry ask for one vodka and one cranberry and then mix them together yourself as they are quite stingy on the liquor in the comp mixed drinks tip your cocktail waitress well it will ensure your drinks get to you quickly plus those poor women have to deal with a lot of drunk assholes all day and its just a nice thing to do besides a buck or two is still a lot cheaper than if youd have paid full price for the drink

 casinos usually have different lines for people to wait on at the box office players club help desk hotel registration etc one line for the members in the lowest tiers of the players club one for the elite tier members the elite line is usually a lot shorter and gets priority you can stand on this line and then pretend you didnt know the difference once its your turn theres a good chance theyll just let it slide

 if youre a girl hang out by a crowded craps table act excitedinterested and mention youve never played before everyone will want you to roll the dice and some might throw you a dollar chip or more if they make money on your roll this is more likely to happen with older wealthy looking gentlemen and in my experience has the lowest success rate of all the things on this list but does happen just fyi

 speaking of craps its not really unethical but youre kind of seen as a jerk if you bet the dont pass line because youre betting against the shooter i dont play craps often but the way i see it is that they wouldnt have the craps table if it wasnt a money maker so the majority of people must be losing at least some money if you do the opposite of the majority maybe youll do better ive found that when a shooter is hot but then something happens to delay their roll like the dice go off the table or something they seven out on the next roll so thats when id bet the dont pass is this just me being superstitious yeah probably

 to kill some time and get free drinks put 5 bucks in one of those oldish game king multigame machines and play keno for 5 cents per game you can make 5 last a long time personally i play caveman keno and pick only 4 numbers while my boyfriend always picks 10 numbers and goes through his 5 while i stay about even note that at some casinos the cocktail waitresses will actually look at your machine and tell you that you have to be betting over 75 cents or some amount per pull in order to get comp drinks but ive only seen that happen a few times i forget which casinos that was at its also pretty normal for them to tell you that you have to be wagering over a certain amount per hand at the table games or to have a certain level players card in order to get the top shelf liquor for free

 the bars in the casino are stocked with matches  so you could grab a bunch for free and maybe a few pens too they could come in handy or also make for a souvenir if youre on vacation

 if you make a complaint about something and bitch long enough about it the host or manager will probably offer you a voucher for free dinner at one of the casinos restaurants or a bottle of wine or a discount on your room if youre staying there ive only done this once because they put me up in a disgusting room that was absolutely filthy they moved me to a new room and gave me a complimentary meal at one of their restaurants but you could probably make something up to bitch about if you want to get unethical about it

 if youre trying to raise enough tier points to get to a higher level players card free parking without actually spending money you could have the players club desk print you a bunch of copies of your card and stick them into a couple slot machines and hope the next person to sit down and play one doesnt take it out to put their own card in youll get the points for all the money they spend in the machine go for the trendy newer slots like the walking dead themed one the simpsons one game of thrones etc those machines tend to have higher minimum bets and will therefore accumulate the points quicker they also tend to be played more by tourists rather than regularslocals and the locals are more likely to take your card out and put their own in the only issue with this is that im not sure if you can have cards in more than two machines at a time so you might not be able to do a bunch at once maybe someone can comment on this


ive personally done all of these tips except the waiting on line one and the sticking my card in slot machines for other people to earn me points but i have seen other people pull off the waiting in line trick and i have forgotten my card in a slot machine many times and came back for it to find someone playing with my card still in there getting points for their play and the using someone elses card for free parking the person who owns the high level card was my friend 

thanks for reading hope this helps some people out on their next trip to the casino id be happy to answer any questions about casinos or las vegas for anybody whos planning a trip out here disclaimer i dont work for a casino i just hang out in them a lot

edit hi everybody this post has got a lot of attention so i want to add there are some people commenting who actually work the floor in casinos who disagree with some of the things ive written so even though i know these things have worked for me you might want to read those comments before actually trying any of the tips and then decide who you want to take advice from thanks for reading",0

examples of when ive done this over voice comms in video games context im british and sound british

one time i got in to an argument with a guy who had a southern us accent  i kept calling him a yankee and when he told me he was a southerner i pretended i thought he meant he was from south america and kept calling him a commie liberal  there was nothing he could do with that level of stupid

another time my vict debate partner was canadian  when i called him an american he was outraged  i convinced him i thought canada was a state in the us and when he tried to tell me it was a separate country i accused him of just splitting hairs

key factors

1  youve really got to convince them youre that dumb dont let them realize its an act

2  just babbling discontinuous nonsense while theyre trying to speak if in voice or radically changing the subject to 12 year old nonsense is very frustrating and can often bring them down to your level  knowing that your partner cant even hear you is incredibly annoying

3  exude a massive amount of unearned confidence and extreme satisfaction in your own bullshit  this one is the most important  you cant relent  think of the adage arguing with a moron is like playing chess with a pigeon  no matter how clever your stratagem the pigeon is just going to crap on the board and prance around like he won",0

if you live in a somewhat large city chances are there might be a live feed of your areas radio traffic already being streamed in that case all you need is an app on your phone

if a live stream isnt available you can get a radio scanner for about 150 for an analog system to 300 for newer digital systems not sure which one you need go to radio referencehttpwwwradioreferencecomappsdb and put your zip code in the search box it will give you a list of all the public safety channels in your area click on the name of the agency and look under mode if it has a its analog d is digital and m is mixed use a digital scanner if you see the letter e that means that channel is encrypted and a scanner wont work see below for a workaround a digital radio can also usually pick up analog signals as well there are programming guides online but many new scanners are plug and play you just punch in your zip code and it programs itself 

so what can i do with a scanner

lots of things ranging from harmless to borderlineillegal

 listen out for traffic accidents or checkpoints and navigate around them

 set your radio in close call mode and it will chirp at any strong signals nearby that means theres generally a cop paramedic or firefighter nearby

 get the scoop on whats going on in the neighborhood

 use it when committing a crime you can hear the police get dispatched so you know when its time to leave you can also hear if theyre going to a call on the other side of town so use that to your advantage

i hear them talking but i cant understand them what do i do

if its just them talking too fast youll get used to it trust me its easy to develop a radio ear in as little as a few hours of listening

many departments use 10codes which are used to shorten messages and provide some very weak security many of you already know a few such as 104 for understood 104 is the only universal 10code but there are some semistandardized lists you can find herehttpcopradarcomtencodesindexhtml if those codes arent the same ones used near you look up 10 codes for the closest large city or state police department they tend to be similar to local 10codes

you dont even need to know what the 10codes are for certain crimes when a call is dispatched the address is almost always given in an uncoded format for example we might say

 all units 1035 in progress at 123 main street responding units acknowledge

so if youre breaking into the house at 123 main street you dont need to know that a 1035 is a burglary you just know that the cops are on their way and its time to get out of there also listen for alert tones such as a long steady beep or a weewoo warble tone that often indicate a serious crime in progress

if you hear static or cant understand much at all you might need a good antenna amazon sells a decent car roof antenna for about 15 and its well worth it range depends on the antenna you get and the system theyre using but for me is generally about 20 miles from the nearest repeater

my local department encrypts their radio channels what can i do

an encrypted system isnt the end of the world if you plan on using a radio for less than legal reasons then its easy to steal one call the cops for a routine theft report or something and have someone else steal the handheld radio from the car dispatch can remotely deactivate a radio but we very rarely do unless you transmit on it and disrupt our operations the nypd has been having issues with stolen radios and they dont even encrypt most of their channels

anything i should be careful about

yes

 a few states such as florida and new york prohibit the use of a scanner in a vehicle unless youre a licensed amateur radio operator which is an easy license to get

 using a scanner during a crime can get you extra charges depending on where you live

 dispatch has no way of knowing if youre using a scanner but officers will often let us know if there are scanners located at an address so we can update our records

 there are other ways for officers and dispatch to communicate they will often relay sensitive information such as a criminal history via phone or an instant messenger system

tldr get a police radio scanner they have many uses if you want to hear what the cops are doing

also if anyone needs help or has questions feel free to pm me

edit id recommend against stealing a radio because you know stealing is bad if its encrypted just take that as a sign that maybe they dont want you listening",0

well behind every single one of those employees only signs on a fence on any main dragusually next to rest rooms has coke machines behind them for the workers with vastly reduced prices ive found as low as 25 cents a can

how it works is no matter what park an employee works at they are given a card that lets you in the park for free any day they are open all year around you could literally go to the park every day for free and most of these passes include a second unlimited pass to get a friend in too but thats besides the point

anyways there are legitimate reasons why someone dressed not as a park employee would be behind those signs like in the situation just described if anyone asked you what you were doing back there or anything you can just say its my day off im with my family no one will bat an eye

361,6fo1y5,"free food and drinks at hotels your mileage may vary

this is a thing my brother used to do and it relies on a few variables and a confidence trick

 walk around a few floors and take note of room service trays left outside doors andor so not disturb door hangers this is how you know which rooms are potentially currently occupied

 make a note of all the numbers of these occupied rooms

 find a house phone and start calling the rooms on your list this is the confidence part my brother used a script like this

hello this is a name at the hotel i just wanted to confirm your breakfast order for tomorrow morning

the person says they havent made a breakfast order

oh im sorry there must be a mistake then what was your last name again

they may or may not tell you

end the call politely as if you actually worked there thank you for choosing hotel chain or something to that effect use their name too if you feel like it hotels are big on details like that and it will further make them feel like nothing is weird as if you knew their name all along 

you may have to make a few calls because people either arent in the room at the time or theyll be smart and wont give you a name this is why its a good idea to get several room numbers

 once someones divulged their name you now have a room number and a name associated with it

all thats left to do is go to the hotel restaurant or bar order whatever you want and charge it to your room

again i have never done this myself directly but i have been with my brother when he did it and i was surprised to see it work this was over 10 years ago when we were 1719 years old",0

620,7s019v,"how to outunethical one of the most unethical professionals on the planet your car salesperson preprestage have good enough credit to qualify for dealer finance that makes this soooo much easier

prestage find your favorite car that is reasonably within your budget familiarize yourself with the ideal trim level and options of the car to preference and budget use kbb truecarcom or other reputable websites to find the invoice pricing of that car with said options and trim invoice pricing is what they supposedly pay for that car they dont really a lot of times they get it cheaper than that use this as a guide as to where to start your offers in all stages offer them no more than 200s over invoice nevereverever pay msrpever oh and zerofuckingdown down payments are for suckers if you can afford financing without zero down even with the best deal you cant afford it get your game face on and prepare for battle over the next few stages its going to be a wild emotionalroller coaster ride 

stage 1 call every car dealership that deals your favorite car ask them for best case scenario with perfect credit you can do this without them running your credit if you threaten to hang up if they dont comply tell each to email you their offer because you cant take calls at work and tell each that you have a vested interest in dealing with them because they treated a family member so well they are going to almost insist you come in to talk numbers fuck that shit make em email them to you first

stage 2 is to then email each dealership eachothers offers before going to any dealership to see if they can beat eachothers and remind each your giving them the inside track because they treated a family member so well

stage 3 is you go to best offers dealership and haggle fucking hard they will whine that they thought they had a deal with you already worked out just tell them you didnt think this would be that easy did you let them struggle to come up with the best they got send them back to their finance guy as much as you can until they wont budge anymore take the paper with the offer outside excuse yourself for phonecall tell them you need to ask a relative for money to get a better down payment when youre out of sight take clear pictures of the offer with your phone come back and tell them you cant come up with a down payment and walk from the deal when the manager comes running out to you in the parking lot to try and salvage the deal tell him if youre so confident youre deal is the best bet me 100 bucks right now that i cant find a better one

stage 4 is going to the second best offer dealership this works best if they have a lot of inventory tell them immediately that you just walked away from a great deal  show them that deal they will also whine that they thought they already had a deal worked out with you but just give them the same oh you thought this would be that easy line tell them to beat the other dealerships deal or youre walking if they cant you can go to your 3rd best offer or go back to the first but at this point youre damn sure you have the best deal you can get if you close on a better deal than your first dealership go collect your 100 bucks from their floor manager enjoy the big w for yourself

today i was ordering art supplies for my daughter  i usually use amazon but i found a place that had the paints for 2 less than amazon 10 instead of amazons 12 and i decided to go with the other seller at checkout i saw the coupon code field and figured id try the coupon call i called and said i saw an advertisement somewhere with a really good discount  she asked where i saw the ad and i just said it was awhile ago so i dont remember if it was a mailer or online but i remembered your company name from it which is what brought me to your website  she ended up giving me the 20 discount code over the phone and instead of 10 i paid 8 for each bottle of paint 

and i just did it again a few hours ago i ordered halloween costumes for my wife and me  since i know halloween shops give huge discounts after halloween i figured id press my luck keep in mind that id never seen a coupon code for this costume place i called and said id seen an ad from last year for 75 off asked if the code was still valid and asked if they could give me the code i got a little worried when she put me on hold but she came back and said i just checked and the code still works  its abc123  and just like that our 400 worth of costume crap was down to 100
