commercial pizzas are baked in stone ovens that get up to 700 1000 degrees which is why they bake so quickly and end up with nice crispy crusts and unburned everything else your home oven will never get that hot but you can try to get as close as possible to emulate the effect 

cook the pizza on the bare rack to maximize air circulation if you dont have a pizza stone or a cast iron skilletslab if you have either of those heat it in the oven first and then cook the pizza on that once the oven hits its max temperature 

for even better pizza brush the crust with olive oil before you bake and sprinkle either fresh garlic or garlic powder on it the garlic flavor helps to balance out the usually heavy handed and far too sweet sauce that goes on your average frozen pizza

although no driver has ever checked my battery terminal the pros out there recommend removing a fuse for your fuel pump but also say they likely will not even attempt to do anything for your vehicle as they just want to clear the call

when you share something so welcome with a group of people especially medical pros that are often having shitsucky days you suddenly start noticing your requests for sleep meds come quicker and are brought faster all your tests get scheduled on the same day and the nurses that stick you for your iv and labs are much gentler and they take more care with you as for the service personnel  you find that theyll trick your food tray out with lots of extras like more butter small snacks and better condiments housekeeping will be extra nice and your techs will stop by your room to check on you more frequently and will bring you the much coveted red popsicles or strawberry yogurt from the snack fridge for patients getting either of those bitches while youre in is like winning the frigging lottery  roommates become less irritable and more friendly visitors to your room are nicer and random patients on the floor are always grateful

examples of when ive done this over voice comms in video games context im british and sound british

one time i got in to an argument with a guy who had a southern us accent  i kept calling him a yankee and when he told me he was a southerner i pretended i thought he meant he was from south america and kept calling him a commie liberal  there was nothing he could do with that level of stupid

another time my vict debate partner was canadian  when i called him an american he was outraged  i convinced him i thought canada was a state in the us and when he tried to tell me it was a separate country i accused him of just splitting hairs

key factors

1  youve really got to convince them youre that dumb dont let them realize its an act

2  just babbling discontinuous nonsense while theyre trying to speak if in voice or radically changing the subject to 12 year old nonsense is very frustrating and can often bring them down to your level  knowing that your partner cant even hear you is incredibly annoying

536,"if adopting an animal from a shelter expect a few initial behavioral issues this is in no way acting as a discouragement ive spent the last 10 years in some sort of animal rehabilitation and shelter volunteering and it breaks my heart to see how often animals get returned after a few days because hes just not adjusting

in many cases the animals ive personally worked with have been rescued from abuse malnourished or strays volunteers work very hard and have several guidelines as to what makes and animal ready for adoption the top 5 complaints ive seen in my experience are

my new dog keeps going to the bathroom in the house first thing to consider in this situation is where was the animal living while at the shelter some shelters may keep their animals in runs or cells and often these animals dont get walked that creates a habit of the animal being used to using the bathroom inside proactive walking really helps correct this problem take your dog out often in the first few weeks and then start to dial it back gradually 

our kitty was so friendly and playful at the shelter now she just hides all day i dont think that were connecting your kitty was so happy and playful because she was somewhere she was accustomed to imagine you may have shared a room with a friend had a set schedule all of a sudden you were taken probably put in a cardboard box also dont leave cats in cardboard carriers cats are sensitive to over heating and it could have life threatening implications bring your own well ventilated carrier when adopting went for a scary ride and were dumped out into a strange environment alone and away from everyone you knew give kitty time shell get into a rhythm with you the best thing you can do right now is provide a clean litter box fresh water and proper feeding at set times dont drag kitty out from under the bed this only enforces the need to find a better spot to hide

new fido does nothing but bark nonstop all day first off this complaint usually comes from apartment dwellers if youre adopting a dog make sure beforehand that your lease allows pets dont just get a dog then when your land lord shows up to say you have to get rid of it claim that its a service dogyour just watching it for a friend fido is alone fido used to be in a place where there was a lot of commotion and all this silence is weird hooman where did you go dogs are pack animals and when theyre alone they feel vulnerable long walks and playtime before you have to leave for an extended period of time are good remedies to this leave a tv on on a low volume to shield all the scary outside noises in my personal experience crate training was a great tool but dont get one too big or too small big enough to stand up without ducking the head and and turn around in this method was recommended to me by my vet and just happened to work but it may not work for you professional consultation about a dogs excessive barking habits is never a bad idea all relationships take work

why does my new pet act so lethargic they were so full of energy when we first met its what i liked about her what are you feeding her is it the same food she was eating at the shelter sudden changes in diet can trigger upset tummies and more negative consequences food changes should be done gradually consult your vet on the best way to do this if they start showing signs of stomach upset it also has to do with the stress of being in a new environment all these knew sights and smells are exhausting to process

our new pet doesnt get along with our existing ones this one is huge how would you feel if your so roommate brought home some guy named chad and was like oh yea chad lives here now dogs even though theyre pack animals and cats can be very territorial this behavior may have only shown up when you caught kitty hair standing on end making those hilarious guttural meowing noises kitty doesnt understand that this new kitten is pet of the family now and not the evil outdoor neighbor cat even though youre in the same household introductions should be done gradually giving each animal an opportunity to sniff and item that has the others scent on it allowing them to sniff though doors etc if your bringing a new dog home to your existing dogs consider taking them to a dog park or anywhere fenced in thats not your house this gives them the chance to interact and also escape each other if they feel really threatened and its not on territory that your dog may be trying to defend make sure interactions are positive this doesnt mean that they get along every time but that the animals get praise for not being aggressive

hope this helps some people navigate the first few days of shelter pet adoption  and ps theres probably a bunch of typos

516,"15 years repairing electronics here with liquid damaged electronics dont use rice instead use a fan explanation inside ive spent nearly 20 years repairing liquidwater damaged electronics more specifically cell phones in the old days wed open the phones up clean the corrosion resolder etc recently theyve the manufacturers moved away from local repairs and moved more towards warranty replacements swap outs fru  factory replacement units  insurance now if you want your electronics repaired locally you have to visit 3rd party independent people since you can no longer have it done in a corporateran store

i know rice is the goto recommendation for water damaged phones and other electronics and it works to an extent it will passively absorb moisture unfortunately you dont want to passively absorb the moisture you want to actively remove the moisture as quickly as possible  the longer the moisture is sitting on those circuit boards the higher the risk of corrosion and corrosion on electrical components can happen within just a few short hours if the damage isnt severe wed take contact cleaner essentially 92 or better rubbing alcohol the higher the percentage the quicker it will evaporate and scrub the white or green powder the corrosion that formed with a toothbrush to remove it if that corrosion crosses contacts it can cause the electronics to act up fail or short out the liquid itself almost never is directly responsible for failed consumer electronics its the corrosion that takes place after the fact or the liquid damaging the battery a new battery fixes this issue obviously 

every time i see someone recommend rice i kinda twinge a little inside because while it does dry a phone out slightly better than just sitting on a counter it really doesnt do much to prevent the corrosion thats going to be taking place due to the length of time the liquid has had to fester inside the phone or whatever 

what you want to do is set the item in front of a fan with constant airflow take the device apart as much as you can without ruining it remove the battery etc so that the insides can get as much airflow as possible even if its not in direct contact with the air the steady air blowing over the device will create a mini vacuum effect and pull air from inside its just a small amount but its significantly better than just allowing the rice to passively absorb the evaporated moisture true rice can act as a desiccant but a fan blowing over whatever is orders of magnitude faster 

i personally will take apart a piece of electronics completely and put those items in front of a fan and if you have the relevant knowledge i highly recommend doing so as well but if you dont its not that big of an issue what you want to avoid at all costs however is heat do not put your phone inside an oven or hot blow dryer heat can damage electronics just as bad as liquid sometimes more so heat extreme cold and liquid are bad for electronics  cell phones a fan lots of airflow is 99 out of 100 times better at removing moisture quickly than rice i would say 100 out of 100 but im sure theres going to be some crazy situation or exception i havent thought of that someone will come in and point out id like to remind people that exceptions are just that they dont invalidate the rule ",1,1

801,"if you see a vehicle accident and dont want to or cant stop to help call 911 even if you think someone definitely must have called 911 already call 911 anyway you will probably be the firstonly person to call background so my family and i were recently in a very serious headon fatality collision on a highway luckily for us our phones were in our jacket pockets when it happened second dont keep your phones loose in your vehicle so when we came to on the side of the highway we were able to call 911 our car was mangled and we couldnt get the doors open so we were stuck inside but i could see through my side window as vehicle after vehicle after vehicle passed by us seriously there were over like 40 vehicles that passed by us 
after getting out of the hospital we were speaking with the police recently and something they said really struck me the only 911 call placed at all was from us not a single person stopped which i can somewhat understand when its dark and icy out but of all of those vehicles nobody even called 911 
if we had been knocked unconscious longer or if our phones had been wrecked in the crash we would have been stuck there for who knows how long my kid probably would have died he needed emergency surgery we could have ended up freezing or bleeding out it was really actually quite depressing when i heard that the only people who called it in were us 
so the next time you see an accident when driving just play it safe and call it in you could save a life

edit to clarify i want to state that yes i would much prefer for everyone to go and help if they witness an accident or emergency as well as call 911 that would 100 be preferable i was just trying to reach the absolute laziest scared ambivalent etc out there and say if you dont stop you should at least call 911 
if your countries laws require you to stop at an emergency and help then yes obviously do that

edit again its been brought up that if its just a minor thing like a fender bender that calling 911 can be a waste of time and resources i agree that this can occur and obviously you have to use your judgement stop and assess if you can as that will help with this but i still stand by my post that if you dont know its better to err on the side of caution and call

766,"use focus sessions and day goals to stay productive at work httpiimgurcomrzwfiskjpg

tldr the link above shows a set of techniques ive implemented as part of my 2016 new years resolution and stick with each day

more descriptions of each section below 
______

 date

 time at desk goal get in as early as possible since morning hours are most productive for me tracking this by writing it down helps give a tiny surge of motivation each morning



 day goals these are intended as a few overarching goals lets say 23 goals for what would make the day successful to you it helps immediately scope the days goals a critical step after you write these down think if at the end of the day i accomplish these 3 things will i feel good about today if that thought leaves you feeling like your day goals are too daunting or too insufficient then revise them before actually starting the day repeat until you feel comfortable with day goals



 morning thoughts i was finding that id come in with a set of emotionally charged thoughts that would then distract me throughout the day taking a few minutes to write down whatever happens to be on my mind whatever i happen to be feeling really helps to clear it or at least postpone the thoughts for when i actually want to make time to process them



 todo list this todo list at least for me is not a comprehensive list of all work items instead it contains things like chores meetings social things smaller menial tasks email checking etc the idea is to give myself less mental credit for a menial task and more credit for working towards my day goals while still recognizing the need to get the menial tasks done



 retrospective how did i actually use my time every couple of hours i update this list with where my time actually went its been super interesting in particular to see how what sometimes might feel like a quick afternoon break to me was actually more like a 2 hour break or something has been very revealing and sometimes helps me with efficiency



 focus sessions these things are magical at least for me my big realization is that previously id reason that eg sending a quick text message takes all of 20 seconds and is no big deal but in reality i was simply not creating the sort of totally focused absolutely uninterrupted time i needed to get things done for real so focus sessions are 12 hour periods set the time just before you begin one where all social media goes off completely not even one exception no text messaging no facebook no reddit ideally no email for 12 hours write down your work goal for the focus session focus sessions have been mind clearing and liberating for me and they are short enough to stick with when the focus session is over you are again free to kick back and catch up on texts its fun if youve accumulated some i try to do anywhere from 36 of these a day and personally find that about 15 hours is a good length of time during focus sessions i listen to music designed to enhance focus such as alpha waveshttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwpni755krg but whatever music works well for you is fine i find its good to have an auditory trigger that you gradually grow to associate with focusing if i am tempted to cheat i remind myself that i am specifically trying to prove that i have selftrust if i say i am going to focus for 15 hours i will selftrust works both ways though  if i say im going to have fun for an hour i should have stressfree fun

edit one more note on focus sessions  you dont necessarily need to work during the full focus session if i need a pause i find that staring out the window for a little while is a good quick rest that does not require a context shift 




hope these techniques ive developed to address my own productivity issues will help some other people too would be curious which parts of this work for other people as well

29,"while playing a table game at a casino secretly pocket some of your own chips so that when you color out the pit boss marks you down as losing more money than you actually did and spending more money gets you more comps more casino tips inside keep in mind the dealers do have an idea of how much you actually lost so you cant go crazy with it also if they catch you doing it more than once they will tell the pit boss about it its not illegal or anything to take your own chips off your stack but they dont like people trying to lie about how much they won or lost when youre done at the table ask to color out and the dealer will exchange your chips for higher denomination ones so theyre easier for you to holdcarry they then call the pit boss over to look at the chips and make sure the dealer exchanged for the right amount this is when the pit boss sees what youre walking away with and marks down how much you won or lost

when you leave a table always cash your chips in at the cage before going to another table and then buy in with cash again at the new table so it appears that you are spending more in the casinos eyes if you sit down at a new table with chips from another table then youre not spending more money just the same money at a different table you want it to look like youre spending a lot the pit boss keeps track of how much you are buying in for each time you sit down at a table you always give them your players card when you sit down so they can put the info on your accountthey also keep track of how much you are wagering per hand but in my opinion its not worth it to wager more than youre comfortable with just to increase your comps you could end up losing a lot more money than what the comps will be worth

 its becoming more and more common for casinos in vegas to charge for parking but parking is free for people in the higher tiers of the players club people accidentally leave their players club cards in slot machines and if you can find a higher tier card someone lost you can use it at the parking ticket machine for free parking for a more ethical version simply ask someone if they can get an extra copy of their card made for you to use for this purpose its easy to get a card made up and many people have 2 or more you cant do anything else with it without knowing their pin so its pretty harmless you can also google which casinos offer free parking and see if theres one within walking distance to your destination

 if you want to watch a game or otherwise hang out in the sports book but dont want to pay ridiculous drink prices find out what their policy is for complimentary drinks for the people betting on horses a sports bet will get you one comp drink voucher but many casinos have a policy where horse players get free drinks without needing to use the drink vouchers this has something to do with horse betting being parimutuel the casino makes money whether you win or lose horse players also tend to spend a lot of money going to the window and betting before each race sometimes multiple tracks at once sit in the horse betting area turn your little personal tv to a racing channel get a racing program and find some losing wager tickets someone left around so it looks like youre betting horses and enjoy free drinks youll be able to see the sports from that area too you may have to place a bet on a race once in a while to keep the facade going but its still cheaper than paying full price for the drinks minimum bet on a horse race is 2 you would also get a free drink voucher when you make the bet if you ask politely they might give you two of them and who knows maybe your horse will win 

 when youre playing a slot machine or table game cocktail waitresses come around and serve complimentary drinks if you want a mixed drink such as vodka and cranberry ask for one vodka and one cranberry and then mix them together yourself as they are quite stingy on the liquor in the comp mixed drinks tip your cocktail waitress well it will ensure your drinks get to you quickly plus those poor women have to deal with a lot of drunk assholes all day and its just a nice thing to do besides a buck or two is still a lot cheaper than if youd have paid full price for the drink

 casinos usually have different lines for people to wait on at the box office players club help desk hotel registration etc one line for the members in the lowest tiers of the players club one for the elite tier members the elite line is usually a lot shorter and gets priority you can stand on this line and then pretend you didnt know the difference once its your turn theres a good chance theyll just let it slide

 if youre a girl hang out by a crowded craps table act excitedinterested and mention youve never played before everyone will want you to roll the dice and some might throw you a dollar chip or more if they make money on your roll this is more likely to happen with older wealthy looking gentlemen and in my experience has the lowest success rate of all the things on this list but does happen just fyi

 speaking of craps its not really unethical but youre kind of seen as a jerk if you bet the dont pass line because youre betting against the shooter i dont play craps often but the way i see it is that they wouldnt have the craps table if it wasnt a money maker so the majority of people must be losing at least some money if you do the opposite of the majority maybe youll do better ive found that when a shooter is hot but then something happens to delay their roll like the dice go off the table or something they seven out on the next roll so thats when id bet the dont pass is this just me being superstitious yeah probably

 to kill some time and get free drinks put 5 bucks in one of those oldish game king multigame machines and play keno for 5 cents per game you can make 5 last a long time personally i play caveman keno and pick only 4 numbers while my boyfriend always picks 10 numbers and goes through his 5 while i stay about even note that at some casinos the cocktail waitresses will actually look at your machine and tell you that you have to be betting over 75 cents or some amount per pull in order to get comp drinks but ive only seen that happen a few times i forget which casinos that was at its also pretty normal for them to tell you that you have to be wagering over a certain amount per hand at the table games or to have a certain level players card in order to get the top shelf liquor for free

 the bars in the casino are stocked with matches  so you could grab a bunch for free and maybe a few pens too they could come in handy or also make for a souvenir if youre on vacation

 if you make a complaint about something and bitch long enough about it the host or manager will probably offer you a voucher for free dinner at one of the casinos restaurants or a bottle of wine or a discount on your room if youre staying there ive only done this once because they put me up in a disgusting room that was absolutely filthy they moved me to a new room and gave me a complimentary meal at one of their restaurants but you could probably make something up to bitch about if you want to get unethical about it

 if youre trying to raise enough tier points to get to a higher level players card free parking without actually spending money you could have the players club desk print you a bunch of copies of your card and stick them into a couple slot machines and hope the next person to sit down and play one doesnt take it out to put their own card in youll get the points for all the money they spend in the machine go for the trendy newer slots like the walking dead themed one the simpsons one game of thrones etc those machines tend to have higher minimum bets and will therefore accumulate the points quicker they also tend to be played more by tourists rather than regularslocals and the locals are more likely to take your card out and put their own in the only issue with this is that im not sure if you can have cards in more than two machines at a time so you might not be able to do a bunch at once maybe someone can comment on this


ive personally done all of these tips except the waiting on line one and the sticking my card in slot machines for other people to earn me points but i have seen other people pull off the waiting in line trick and i have forgotten my card in a slot machine many times and came back for it to find someone playing with my card still in there getting points for their play and the using someone elses card for free parking the person who owns the high level card was my friend 

thanks for reading hope this helps some people out on their next trip to the casino id be happy to answer any questions about casinos or las vegas for anybody whos planning a trip out here disclaimer i dont work for a casino i just hang out in them a lot

edit hi everybody this post has got a lot of attention so i want to add there are some people commenting who actually work the floor in casinos who disagree with some of the things ive written so even though i know these things have worked for me you might want to read those comments before actually trying any of the tips and then decide who you want to take advice from thanks for reading",0,1

361,"free food and drinks at hotels your mileage may vary

this is a thing my brother used to do and it relies on a few variables and a confidence trick

 walk around a few floors and take note of room service trays left outside doors andor so not disturb door hangers this is how you know which rooms are potentially currently occupied

 make a note of all the numbers of these occupied rooms

 find a house phone and start calling the rooms on your list this is the confidence part my brother used a script like this

hello this is a name at the hotel i just wanted to confirm your breakfast order for tomorrow morning

the person says they havent made a breakfast order

oh im sorry there must be a mistake then what was your last name again

they may or may not tell you

end the call politely as if you actually worked there thank you for choosing hotel chain or something to that effect use their name too if you feel like it hotels are big on details like that and it will further make them feel like nothing is weird as if you knew their name all along 

you may have to make a few calls because people either arent in the room at the time or theyll be smart and wont give you a name this is why its a good idea to get several room numbers

 once someones divulged their name you now have a room number and a name associated with it

all thats left to do is go to the hotel restaurant or bar order whatever you want and charge it to your room

again i have never done this myself directly but i have been with my brother when he did it and i was surprised to see it work this was over 10 years ago when we were 1719 years old",0,1

and yet so many of us just waste ungodly amounts of our time we throw it away every day i know i do unless im careful what helps me to not waste time is to see it as an investment and to keep track of the returns i get for my investment 

this approach has led me to recognize that some things offer incredible immediate return on investment a night spent learning a new song on my preferred instruments for example gives me a lifetime of being able to play that song thats an incredible return other investments are more like lowinterest high security longterm investments going to the gym eating right etc some like reading good books are kind of a combination of both 

but many activities are worthless from an investment perspective whatever benefit they seem to give doesnt last any longer than the activity itself reddit is a great example i can get superinvested in a reddit conversation but at the end the second i shut down my computer ive gained nothing in return it gives me absolutely nothing of value ive invested my time into junk 

edit some obvious things here first of all whats valuable and not is ultimately your own personal judgement if you feel that your time spent on reddit helps you build the life that you want then by all means fill your boots it doesnt build the life that i want though  and yes im aware that that seems hypocritical but the fact is that i am highly aware that im procrastinating right now and that ill loathe my time spent on reddit when i lay my pretty head down to sleep tonight 

edit sorry i criticized reddit omg but for real maybe you guys are all just a hell of a lot more disciplined on here than i am you come for salient information trenchant and highminded interactions with others and then you sign out in a crisp and efficient manner not i reddit is one of my boogeymen so feel free to substitute your own timewaster

final edit holy smokes if i would have known this was going to blow up i would have taken more than 45 seconds to write it and would have made some things a bit clearer theres some confusion or perhaps defensiveness about the point i was trying to make first of all the examples that i used were all solitary pursuits but that was just random  for instance for myself i dont think that theres a better investment of my time than playing music with my friends or going on trips with friends and family those memories last a lifetime absolutely worth every second  and dollar secondly i definitely dont want to imply that time invested in experiences is a waste  thats the exact opposite of what im trying to say experiences rather than material things are what ive chased for most of my adult life 

really this never should have blown up because its not profound in the least we all know that wasting time leads to unhappiness all i was trying to say is that one strategy that has helped me to avoid wasting time is to see time spent on something as an investment and to question what return on it im getting investing my time in learning a new skill being a good husband and father making new memories with friends and family  those investments will yield a good life other investments wont  eating junk food late at night on reddit for example and for me yes reddit is a serious time sink  something that im trying to deal with 

lastly id push back a tiny little bit against people saying that time spent enjoying yourself isnt wasted mostly i agree but sometimes avoidance takes the form of enjoyment if theres something that i know i need to do and i watch netflix instead hell yeah i enjoy myself during that time doesnt mean that it wasnt a shitty investment of time though so dont confuse avoidanceescapism with true enjoyment",1,1

186,"after college once you get the first job start looking for a better job after a year or two dont stay out of loyalty because trust me no company is loyal to their employees be respectful and professional but loyalty in a company is rarely noticed and appreciated  unless maybe if its your dads company


as a person who has worked for a same company for 6 years after graduating i found out i didnt get a single raise within it unless i ask for it every fucking year never got much other benefit than initially signed while studying at school


so i started applying for 5 months and finally got a job it pays me almost 5 edit 4 is more accurate benefits such as health care lunch gym etc times as much as i used to my friend from same school with same seniority was getting 4 times my salary for the last 2 years already


my mistake was thinking that being loyal to this company was gonna in return make the company loyal to me the company only wants lower costs loyalty has no place here


edit wow didnt expect this response also apparently this is very common in it sector but applies to pretty much all industry and i am in the it sector   still feels so unfair


edit 2  as some pointed out try not to be a job hopper this depends heavily on the industry you are working in though

on their website this isp does not seem to offer any plan that has 20 down2 up internet speed they do have a 10d1u singleuser service standalone internet but in their package deals they only had 50 100 500 and 1000 internet speeds no 20

turns out weve been paying for the same service at the same rate for the past 15 years so while highspeed internet was getting faster and the cost was going down we were still paying what was considered a fair price for what was considered a high speed in the early 2000s

one call to the isp our plan was changed over the phone and a tech came out today and installed the new modem we are now getting 1gbps up down 50 mbps down up have the same phone and cable service as before and are paying 30 a month less than before

edit for like the 50th time i typed down when i meant to type up and up when i meant to type down my speed is 1g down 50m up not the other way around

also as people have mentioned in the comments this doesnt apply to every isp and in fact some isps will do the opposite they will actually prohibit you from upgrading your plan if youre a longtime user as their good deals are only for new customers wow seems to be pretty decent as far as customer service goes but i cant speak for any other isp",1,1

255,"daily use of the art of upod underpromising overdelivering will help your life tell your so that you will be home at 6pm and you are home at 630pm doghouse tell them you will be home at 7pm and arrive at 630 hero 50 of successful relationships are about managing expectations underpromise overdeliver upod  not new advice i know but there are some very specific caveats to be successful at this    these are specifics that have helped me in my parenting of my 4 children my successful career in the pursuit of an md phd in neuroscienceneurology my marriage of almost 12 years and even my selfconfidence yes i under promise and over deliver in my personal expectations  

1 realize that underpromising and overdelivering is not an attempt to be dishonest it can actually be more honest giving you a buffer in case weird stuff comes up traffic health issues the other obligation you hadnt originally factored in people often tell if you are just lying to them to impress them 

2 upod only works in relationships in the long term if the underpromise is still relatively close to what your gut estimate would have been in the first place  you shouldnt tell your so that you will be home at 10pm every evening and show up at 630pm every day as 630pm will be the new expectation regardless of what you say and what you say will lose credibility

3  dont overpromise to try to initially impress someone it will hurt you in the end  if you are like me you want others to think highly of you which might tempt you to offer to do something quicker or much better than you probably cant do or only can do under ideal circumstances  this is especially true for people in new jobs and new relationships  although this might work out for you initially you work crazy hours to meet a crazy deadline that you set for yourself to impress someone it comes with some natural consequences that are nobodys fault but your own  first of all you have now set the bar very high for yourself making it difficult to over upod with them again  many will going forward expect you to maintain that expectation of you going forward  second even if you somehow manage to keep it up you will eventually opud over promise and under deliver which can really hurt you in the end  you might also come to resent the other person because of their expectations of you even though in truth you were the one that initially seeded those expectations in the first place  

4 when starting out buffer upod with i wish statements  i have 4 kids and with my md phd training i literally cannot make it to all of my childrens extracurricular events  at the beginning of each school year i remind my kids that although i wish i could make it to every event i will not be able to attend everything every time i show up my kids are totally stoked  i sometimes wait until just a few hours before to let my kids know i can make it to an event even though my wife has a much more advanced heads up just to manage expectations  although some might say that this makes it hard for my kids to feel that they can rely on me or trust me i have found quite the opposite  i have an almost 100 success rate at being to the things that i say i will be at 

5 when employing upod focus conversations on what you know 100 that you can do  for instance when a colleague is really trying to pressure you to attend a conference that you probably dont have time to attend reply with i really wish i could go but i probably cant  could you do me a favor when you get back and do lunch with me to discuss the interesting tidbits you learnedshared at the conference   when a customer at your restaurant asks you to make a specialty order that you are not sure the chef can do let them know i will check with the chef to see if i can do this for you but it is unlikely that we can do this  however i can bring you some free extra breadsticks that i can see you have all enjoyed so much this evening   

6  you can maintain an optimistic attitude while still upoding to yourself  i just realized that upoding yourself sounds really weird but my point is that it helps to have realistic expectations of yourself and to give yourself some buffer  i used to always tell myself that i would get more workhomework done over christmas vacation  turns out i was always disappointed at how much i actually got done  now before the break i tell myself i will be happy to get 10 or so hours worth of work done each vacation period if i get more done i am pretty proud of myself   for instance even though i spent about an hour putting this post together i am only really expecting it to be looked at by about 20 people with only about 5 or 6 reading all the way to this point  this is okay to me as if it helps even one or two people enjoy the success i have it is worth it also i plan on sharing some of this directly with my close friends and family   

7 underexpect in your own relationships with others and give people a break  realize that thing come up and that everyone is fighting a hard battle  teach them in gentle ways how to upod 

8 in some instances it is okay to let them know that you are upoding  example tell your friends that you would love to play games with them online this evening but you are pretty sure that your boss is likely going to keep you after work because he usually does on a friday evening  i say some instances because excessive explanations might actually get them to distrust you especially if the explanations are beyond their current level of comprehension  for example for some when a mechanic or doctor starts using words that no one has ever heard of people become suspicious or resentful of that person  for instance you dont need to explain why the pizza might be an extra 5 minutes later just quote them 5minutes later and wow them when you get there 10 minutes early  

i apologize if this felt like a lecture i just would have loved if a parent or mentor had shared these with me before i had to learn many of these caveats the hard way    thanks for those of you that made it through all of this i am excited to hear from you about what you have learned about the art of upod

tldr  underpromising and overdelivering has helped my life and will help your life but there is an art to it

773,"caring what other people think about you is just part of being young the sooner you can learn to let go of your attachment to other peoples validation the sooner you begin to live your real life before retirement as a shy individual who spends a lot of my time beating myself up the number one thing i hear from people in their 50s if i tell them this about myself is this you remind me of a younger me 

point being caring what others think is just sort of programmed into the minds of the average young person but nobody really cares what others think about them by the time they reach their 50s they just dont theyve lived enough life to see that it literally serves no point but theyre the same person we are so attached to it that we feel like validation from our peers is literally essential to survival but it is not in any way whatsoever so many of the older people i talk to just say they feel the exact same as they did when they were in their prime just now they are in a 50 year old body

so for the love of god stop caring what others think of you find something you love put the horse blinders on and just do the shit out of what makes you happy there is absolutely no reason whatsoever that you need to care about how other people are perceiving you it is only causing you unnecessary stress at which nothing can be gained even if you think youre doing everything right to keep others happy losing battle

maybe your life has become so unconsciously centered around winning other peoples validation that you dont even know what im talking about you have a following and that keeps you going but you dont really know yourself that well youre going to be addicted to tangible destructive things when you get older gambling smoking drinking etc because you cant get anybody to care about what youre doing anymore because youre old now and nobody really cares about what youre doing or who you are minus maybe your immediate family if you have any i know that was a harsh sentence but the right people will know what im trying to get at youre one of the type of person that seriously needs help before its too late what you may think is socialization and healthy conversation with others about your life achievements and why youre definitely going to heaven is just your brain subconsciously trying to get a fix of selfvalidation off the person im going to make sure this person knows how amazing i am and then breathe a sigh of relief  like you just stuck a needle in your vein

point in summary just about everyone who gets past the age of 50 stops caring what others think about them because they finally see that it serves absolutely no purpose so if youre young take their advice get the ball rolling early its easier said than done but with a bit of courage you can make your path by walking were all made of the same thing so trying to keep everybody happy and constantly gaining reassurance that youre okay and everybody likes you is an addictive activity that serves zero purpose the sooner you can legitimately stop caring what others think about you and just listen to yourself and trust yourself and your true endeavors the sooner you have eliminated a toxic addiction from your body that will have bad longterm effects

most people would agree that the idea of speaking in front of large groups of people can be terrifying and so we tend to avoid it whenever possible there are times however when we are faced with the task and theres no running away we must say a few words the following is a template for success which you can use when its your turn to speak in just about any type of gathering formal or informal 


1 the greeting

good

the greeting is the easy part you begin by simply wishing your audience a good morning afternoon evening or whatever time of day it is good evening everybody

2 state the event

as we all know

the second part is also very easy you simply state the obvious and remind everybody what the purpose of the event or celebration is and what youre all doing there as we all know were here to celebrate the marriage of john and kate and to show them our support as they begin their journey of love and life together now youve got the ball rolling and the words are coming out easily you look like you know what youre doing up there and people are listening so now its time to

3 establish common ground

weve all

its important to include your audience as part of the message youre delivering talk about something both yourself and your audience can relate to regarding the event or celebration weve all had the wonderful opportunity to get to know john and kate and enjoy watching their love develop

4 state why youre speaking

i

include a personal account or tell a brief story to let people know why you specifically are talking what gives you the right to be speaking ive personally been very lucky to have john as a close friend of mine and its been quite amazing to watch how hes grown as a person and couldnt be more pleased for him to have found someone like kate to go about his life with 

5 call for action

so lets all

finally close your speech with a call for action this lets everybody know that youre finished without you having to awkwardly say thats it or im finished thank youthat is how every weak speech is concluded and makes the audience uncomfortable you should say something like so lets all raise a glass to john and kate and wish them well cheers or so lets all give a big round of applause to mark for the outstanding job hes done while working with the company 


obviously there are many different ways these leading lines can be used but if you can commit them to memory and be prepared to use them next time you might be asked to speak you will let go of all fear and anxiety and people will be so impressed with your ability to get up and give a confident fluent speech in front of a group of people while looking like you didnt even have to prepare good luck and happy public speaking",1,1
205,"never take a problem to your boss until you have multiple solutions to it it may seem obvious to some but imagine the difference between an employee coming to you with a problem that you then have to figure out how to solve vs an employee coming to you with a problem they already have several solutions for and you simply need to choose as the manager which option you believe is best 

in my experience when most employees come across a problem they dont know how to instantly solve they simply present it to their manager and wait for a response 

this does nothing other than concrete your managers opinion that you are unable to do their job and they subconsciously disqualify you from promotion presenting them with multiple solutions to a problem however makes them feel they are in control whilst simultaneously considering you as an asset worthy of promotion or at the very least retention

edit couple of things that have come up

1 time frame  i wasnt suggesting withholding critical information from your superior if you have 30 seconds to tell them come up with some ideas in that 30 seconds even if they are bad ideas it shows you are willing to employ critical thinking in important situations you can teach someone with bad ideas how to improve them you cant teach someone with no ideas how to have them

2 trivial matters  obviously dont bother your boss with trivial decisions that are a normal part of your job it should be clear based on the roles and responsibilities of your position which decisions need management oversight and which are well within your jurisdiction to make if that distinction is unclear it is certainly something you should clarify with your manager

3 you should just make the decision yourself  in many situations this is correct from a pure efficiency standpoint but often if you dont take things to a manager your solving them goes unnoticed and your clever decision making is superfluous it is a fine line between irritating and impressing your manager and that line can vary wildly depending on the individual but generally speaking when combined with common sense it works

4 management perspective  i am not currently a manager over the past 20 years i have bounced back and forth between employeremployee in different companies combined roughly 8 years as a manager and 12 years as an employee i am not complaining about my current situation i am very happy and follow this on a daily basis

edit 2 thankyou all so much i really didnt expect this and the different perspectives presented in this thread are mind blowing the other i follow is seek first to understand and you have all helped me and hopefully others to do just that

important note to this only registered dietitians or rdns registered dietician nutritionists are technically certified to diagnose  treat foodnutrition related illnesses diseases  conditions such as eating disorders  deficiencies 

1 some or most people might spell it dietitian not dietician unsure if one is correct or if its just regional


2 ymmv certain countries or states likely have different regulations on this afaik in  most parts of the us and uk nutritionists can get some sort of certification and higher ed training but its not generally required and its not as regulated as a dietitian or registered dietitian  in almost all cases anything like diet coach or nutrition coach or heath coach or nutritional specialist are bs terms main takeaway from this is do your research on your own country or states rules and be careful who you trust


3 im not intending to imply that there arent any nutritionists with 4 year degrees graduate degrees or proper training just saying rigorous education  certification is not always required unlike dietitian which is a regulated  protected term almost universally im sure there are some great knowledgeable nutritionists and nutritional therapists out thereand some terrible quack dietitians again do your research and be careful who you trust

751,"when leaving a job or even getting fired do it as gracefully as possible this may be obvious to many but i think its very common especially for younger less experienced people to exit a job and want to stir things up dramatically perhaps out of bitterness or wanting petty revenge on whoever wronged you

revenge is cheap and worth perhaps a little vindictive pleasure but ultimately it is likely to hurt you in the long run people talk your superiors are better connected than you are and word gets around fast dont burn bridges unless you absolutely have to 

real life example last year i was fired from my job for the worst reason  underperformance i sat down in front of both directors and had them tell me in no uncertain terms this was an incontrovertible decision i was angry i felt wronged my situation was complicated and they werent hearing my side however i listened to what they said discussed a few points and at the end of the meeting thanked them for the opportunity shook hands and calmly explained to them everything theyd need to do to hand over my accountspasswords etc

doing this ended up with being able to put one of those directors down as a reference which in turn has helped secure a new position for a great company ive heard that he was especially complimentary towards me

267,"a goal towards a tidier home is not through periodic binge cleaning but by keeping the house clean through small everyday tasks to have a tidy livable house that is always ready for unexpected visitors you should focus on small tasks that keep your house clean everyday

for example if you pick up a book or a magazine up or play a board game put it back after use

if you use a blanket fold it up after you get up anything that is displaced when in use  even a pencil or a remote

instead of piling dishes in the sink try to wash your cup or plate immediately after you use it this will leave the sink free and you will only need to wash the larger cooking dishes after youre done cooking 
extra protip if you have something on the kitchen counter put it where it belongs even in the sink so that your counter is always clear even if your sink is piled up with large dishes but you have clean counters its still a better look than a tidy sink surrounded by dirty counters

what this leaves is a tidier clutter free home which will only require mostly vaccuming dusting andor mopping when unexpected visitors arrive you dont have to scramble

i never have to do much in my room my closet is a bit tougher to maintain but the rest of the things are always tidy and in their place i have siblings who keep their rooms messy and then they binge clean later it works for them but i dont think thats an efficient method

of course its harder when there are more people in the house but if you encourage as many people as you can then the clutter will reduce

edit massive response thanks the point is to do small tasks everyday so that it 1 doesnt buildup 2 helps you maintain a habit of cleanliness where you naturally clean something the moment you see it 3 makes your homes default setting as clean  

also if your house is massively cluttered then its a good idea to do a binge clean first and then maintain it by doing small chores everyday its said that if you do something for long enough say 40 days it becomes a habit 
edit 2 when you rely on binge cleaning your mindset is that you dont want to do it now because you can do it later this makes you less likely to clean as you go whats the point when you can do it later so the best way is to binge clean once and maintain it by cleaning after yourself

637,"use the extension html5 at the end of any youtube video to make it load as html5 instead of flash much more efficient at loading videos and plays back more effectively or use httpswwwyoutubecomhtml5 to automatically make all videos htlm5 

last updated february 17 2015  1100 pm



note every video should automatically play in html5 format however the occasional video may slip through and play as flash that is why i provided the tip to make an individual video html5

ie



flash httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtmeojfno6do



html5 httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtmeojfno6dohtml5



fun facts about html5 on youtube

 you can playback the video in 025x 05x 1x 125x 15x and 2x speed

 some users may experience an issue where you cant always get full hd videos depending on the browsers

 videos load more efficiently and will keep loading until the end you can also go to any point in the video without having to wait for the video to reload videos will load slower in the background to make room for other bandwidth activities such as games streaming ect

 going into fullscreen automatically sets the video to 720p when minimized it reverts back to what ever the previous resolution was without having to reload it meaning you can have an entire video loaded in 360p or 240 go to fullscreen in 720p it will have to load and when you click out of fullscreen the original 360p will continue playing without the need to reload the rest of the video also works if you are in fullscreen and select the previous resolution that will play the fully loaded version in fullscreen without having to wait again 

 works with embedded videos on other nonyoutube sites automatically d 

 general use for both flash and html5 press m to mute the audio

 the snake game easter egg does not work in html5

 with both flash and html5 press j to rewind 10 seconds k to pauseplay and l to skip ahead 10 seconds

 press the leftright arrow keys to skim across the video by a few seconds dependant on the key direction



its essentially kinda like how its gif to gfy d

701,"in a notatfault automobile accident you are entitled to a check for the value that your car lost due to the collision but youll only get it if you ask for it a car that has been patched up is worth less than a car that is clean this is better known as diminished value any damage to your vehicle is recorded under the vin and when it comes time to resell your car people will pay less for it insurance companies acknowledge this but they wont mention diminished value to you your own insurance company probably wont mention it either since it isnt their responsibility to pay it out youll only get it by asking

heres the process

1 give your side of the story to the other persons insurance company like normal but make a note of the namenumber for the agent you spoke to

2 wait until the insurance companies agree on who is at fault that usually takes a couple of weeks and you can call your own insurance company for an update

3 call up the agent for the other insurance company and tell him you are pursuing diminished value depending on the size of the office theyll either send you off to someone else or theyll help you it helps to have their claim number as a reference

3 be courteous nothing is more irritating than nonlawyers impressing their legal rights on a customer service agent

4 answer their questions sometimes theyll send an agent to inspect the car after its been fixed sometimes they wont but in 310 days theyll provide you an offer

5 accepting or declining the offer is up to you but once you arrive at a figure that is amenable to both sides you sign a document waiving your right to sue the insurance company for this collision once they have that they mail you a check


one phone call but guess what happens if you dont make that phone call nothing

my personal examples

vehicle hyundai tucson

estimated value before collision 1765000

damage rear ended most of the trunk had to be replaced

cost to repair 176500

diminished value offer 88250


vehicle hyundai tucson

estimated value before collision 1595000

damage tboned in an intersection side of car replaced and frame had to be corrected

cost to repair 327500

diminished value offer 130000

if you get this extension you will have no excuse to not know a word that is on a article or text book online its very simple doubleclick or highlight over a word you dont know and it will define it for you i imagine any science or legal majors will love this one in particular 

grammarly for chromehttpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailgrammarlyforchromekbfnbcaeplbcioakkpcpgfkobkghlhenhlen
i often use bad grammar and i know it this extension gives me shit for it all the time but it helps it highlights grammatical or spelling errors for you anywhere and allows you to quickly correct it 

readabilityhttpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailreadabilityoknpjjbmpnndlpmnhmekjpocelpnlfdihlen
this extension simply aims to trim the fat off of articles to provide you with the main point i would not trust it for anything in depth but if you are running low on time and need to skim an article id give this a shot 

speakithttpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailspeakitpgeolalilifpodheeocdmbhehgnkkbakhlenus

i know i cant be the only lazy shit who sometimes does not want to actually use my eyes to read text books or articles this app lets you highlight over text you click a button and a pleasant voice reads it to you as you browse reddit or i guess you could take notes as you listen too

it works in several different languages and accents if you somehow understand germanenglish accents over the default one you can also control the speed that it talks to you in words per minute i could see myself playing it out loud randomly just to try and feed the information into my brain but i would still recommend reading like a normal person every once in a while too

bonus tips that i learned


make a folder on your bookmark tab and slide all of your nonproductive websites in there leave a bookmark for any of your online school based websites it will be hard but it has helped me stay away from time wasting sites 

use sleepytimehttpsleepytime for your late night studies or binges its a simple interface that aims to synch you up with your rem cycles for the best sleep possible i cannot say it works every time but this site has saved me some cranky days as i stayed up too late studying 

use rainymoodhttpsrainymoodcom to destress yourself im sure many of you know about it but i love this one

im sure i have missed a lot of good extensions and tips feel free to tell me any i should try out

744,"record your voice for the people who love you my father passed away at the beginning of march due to cancer one of the things i now cherish most are the handful of his voicemails i have on my phone none have deeply meaningful messages they are all pretty standard voicemails of missed calls from a parent some are confirmations for dinner plans later in the week some are ideas he thought would make millions but already exist some are the classic just checking in bud messages 

however hearing his voice knowing now i cant call him back or ever hear it in person again is sacred it brings me to tears listening to them but it also instantly puts a smile on my face i think everyone should take some time whether its once for a few minutes or biweekly sessions to record some type of message for their loved ones the important part doesnt have to solely be in which words you say but rather in the fact that you are saying them todays technology makes this extremely easy 

death is the one certainty we all must face when each of us is gone our voice is comfort to the people we love

this can be a daunting project if you have a ton of photos but its very rewarding too you can instantly make your friends and familys faces light up as they see your photos and remember the old days

what youll get in return is hearing old stories youve forgotten about or never knew and the appreciation of the people youve photographed over the years

i hosted a party once and excused myself for a moment to dig up a couple old photos i had of two of the attendees one of them brought his girlfriend and i showed it to her first she had never seen a picture of her boyfriend that was more than a few years old they were both elated

i would suggest doing this privately as opposed to randomly posting it on their facebook wall for example let them decide if it belongs on social media in order to avoid any potential embarrassment
